abstract = {This paper presents a new hybrid model, called ENN-SA, for spatiotemporal drought prediction. In ENN-SA, an Elman neural network (ENN) is conjugated with simulated annealing (SA) optimization and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms for the standardized precipitation index (SPI) modeling at multiple stations. The proposed model could be applied to predict SPI at different time scales in a meteorology station with lack of data through the intelligent use of SPI series of the nearby stations as the model inputs. The capability of the hybrid model for multi-station prediction of meteorological drought was examined through the cross-validation technique for Kecioren station in Ankara Province, Turkey. To this end, the SPI-3, SPI-6, and SPI-12 at the station were modeled using the same indices of five nearby stations. In the first step, SVM was trained using different kernels in order to generate and classify a set of plausible multi-station prediction scenarios. Then, ENN was used to regress the SPI series at each scenario and finally, the SA component of the integrated model was utilized to improve the ENN efficiency. Various error and complexity measures were used to detect the models’ performance. The results showed the ENN-SA is promising and efficient for multi-station SPI prediction.}

abstract={This paper presents a new tree-based model, namely Fuzzy Random Forest (FRF), for one month ahead Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) classification and prediction with a noteworthy application in ungauged catchments. The proposed FRF model uses global SPEI dataset as the meteorological drought quantifier and applies a fuzzy inference system to extract fuzzified and crisp SPEI values for an ungauged catchment. The evolved crisp series is then transformed into the polynomial label vector of extremely wet, wet, near normal, dry, and extremely dry categories. In the end, the state-of-the-art random forest algorithm was used to classify and predict the label vector using the lagged SPEI series of the selected global grid points. To demonstrate the development and verification process of the FRF model, the global SPEI-6 values for the period of 1961--2015 were retrieved from four global grid points around the Central Antalya Basin, Turkey. The new model was trained and validated using 70{\%} and 30{\%} of the data sets, respectively. The performance of the new model was examined in terms of total accuracy, misclassification, and Kappa statistics and cross-validated with the fuzzy decision tree model developed as the benchmark in this study. The results showed the promising performance of the FRF for drought classification and prediction with outstanding efficiency for extremely wet and dry events classification. According to the Kappa statistic, the proposed FRF model is 25{\%} more accurate than the benchmark FDT model.},

 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},
