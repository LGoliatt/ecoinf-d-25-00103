AB  - Drought is a short engagement in water or moisture availability substantially under the regular or expected. The amount for particular length drought occasions is recognized month-to-month. In this study, rainfall records from Bangladesh Meteorological Department Bangladesh with proved standard precipitation index (SPI) between 1981 and 2017 are used. Historical document of drought is received from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. The International Disaster Database may be used to validate the SPI result, and SPI is calculated at the District of Dinajpur in Bangladesh. The SPI can observe droughtphenomena on a nearby scale. For this study, we have calculated SPI scale value for the dataset of rainfall like SPI month-1; month-3, month-6, month-9, and month-12, and we have used the short-term scale value for detecting the drought scale. We have calculated in this one sub-area throughout the country to detect the drought using shiny packages which is server based. In our study, we have observed that moderate drought frequency is excessive anywhere in the country. Based on the forecasting method FB Prophet which is also known as time series algorithm for forecasting, we have predicted the future year SPI value for the month which has given most moderate drought according to our study. Our main purpose is to be able to detect the drought of upcoming year so that we can be able to take necessary steps to prevent it. In our study, the forecasting methods are most accurate to predict the drought forecast for future. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.

AB  - Kazakhstan is recently experiencing an increase in drought trends. However, low-capacity probabilistic drought forecasts and poor dissemination have led to a drought crisis in 2021 that resulted in the loss of thousands of livestock. To improve drought forecasting accuracy, this study applies Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ML and DL) algorithms to capture the sequences of drought events using a non-contiguous drought analysis (NCDA). Precipitation, 2-m temperature, runoff, solar radiation, relative humidity, and evaporation were collected from the ERA5 database as input variables. Combinations of inputs were used to build ML models, including seven classifiers (Logistic, K-NN, Kernel SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and GRU). The output events were defined by standardized precipitation index (SPI) and SPEI indicators as binary classes. Weekly time series from 1991 to 2021 for each cell were used to forecast a lead time from 1 week to 6 months. GRU provided 97–99% accuracy in more volatile regions while Random Forest and XGBoost showed 94–99% accuracy at a lead time of 6 months. The accuracy evaluation was based on the confusion matrix and F1 score to analyze the stage change capture. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using ML and DL algorithms for drought forecasting, with potential applications for other regions. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The modelling of drought is of utmost importance for the efficient management of water resources. This article used the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and support vector machine (SVM) models to forecast meteorological droughts in Iran. The spatial–temporal pattern of droughts in Iran was also found using recorded observation data from 1980 to 2014. A nomadic people algorithm (NPA) was utilized to train the ANFIS, MLP, RBFNN, and SVM models. Additionally, the NPA was benchmarked against the bat algorithm, salp swarm algorithm, and krill algorithm (KA). The hybrid ANFIS, MLP, RBFNN, and SVM models were used to forecast the 3-month standardized precipitation index. New evolutionary algorithms were utilized to improve the convergence speed of the soft computing models and their accuracy. First, random stations, namely, in Azarbayjan (northwest Iran), Khouzestan (southwest Iran), Khorasan (northeast Iran), and Sistan and Balouchestan (southeast Iran) were selected for the testing of the models. According to the results obtained from the Azarbayjan station, the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) was 0.93, 0.86, 0.85, and 0.83 for the ANFIS–NPA, MLP–NPA, RBFNN–NPA, and SVM–NPA models, respectively. For Sistan and Baloucehstan, the results indicated the superiority of the ANFIS–NPA model, followed by the MLP–NPA model, compared to the RBFNN–NPA and SVM–NPA models, and suggested that the hybrid models performed better than the standalone MLP, RBFNN, ANFIS, and SVM models. The second aim of the study was to capture the relationship between large-scale climate signals and drought indices by using a wavelet coherence analysis. The general results indicated that the NPA and wavelet coherence analysis are useful tools for modelling drought indices. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This work presents a new approach to defining drought by establishing an empirical relationship between historical droughts (and wet spells) documented in impact reports, and a broad range of observed climate features using Random Forest (RF) models. The new drought indicator quantifies the conditional probability of drought, considering multiple drought-related climate features and their interactive effects, and can be used for forecasting with up to 3-month lead time. The approach was tested out-of-sample across several random selections of training and testing datasets, and demonstrated better predictive capabilities than commonly used drought indicators (e.g., Standardised Precipitation Index and Evaporative Demand Drought Index) in a range of performance metrics. Furthermore, it showed comparable performance to the (expert elicitation-based) US Drought Monitor (USDM), the current state-of-the-art record of historical drought in the USA. As well as providing an alternative historical drought indicator to USDM, the RF approach offers additional advantages by being automated, by providing drought information at the grid-scale, and by having forecasting capacity. While traditional drought metrics define drought as extreme anomalies in drought-related variables, the approach presented here reveals the full suite of circumstances that lead to impactful droughts. We highlight several combinations of climate features—such as precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture and change in water storage—that led to drought events not detected by commonly used drought metrics. The new RF drought indicator combines meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, and socioeconomic drought, providing drought information for all impacted sectors. As a proof-of-concept, the RF drought indicator was trained on Texan climate data and droughts. © 2022. The Authors.

AB  - Water resources, land and soil degradation, desertification, agricultural productivity, and food security are all adversely influenced by drought. The prediction of meteorological droughts using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) is crucial for water resource management. The modeling results for SPI at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months are based on five types of machine learning: support vector machine (SVM), additive regression, bagging, random subspace, and random forest. After training, testing, and cross-validation at five folds on sub-basin 1, the results concluded that SVM is the most effective model for predicting SPI for different months (3, 6, 9, and 12). Then, SVM, as the best model, was applied on sub-basin 2 for predicting SPI at different timescales and it achieved satisfactory outcomes. Its performance was validated on sub-basin 2 and satisfactory results were achieved. The suggested model performed better than the other models for estimating drought at sub-basins during the testing phase. The suggested model could be used to predict meteorological drought on several timescales, choose remedial measures for research basin, and assist in the management of sustainable water resources. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Point predictions of hydroclimatic processes through nonlinear modeling tools are associated with uncertainty. The main goal of this research was to construct prediction intervals (PIs) for nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN)-based models of evaporation and the standardized precipitation index (SPI). These are two critical indicators for climate for four stations in Iran (i.e., Tabriz, Urmia, Ardabil, and Ahvaz) to qualify their predicted uncertainty values (UVs). We used classical techniques of bootstrap (BS), mean variance estimation (MVE), and Delta, as well as an optimization-based method of lower upper bound estimation (LUBE), to construct and compare the PIs. The wavelet-based denoising method was also adopted to denoise input data, enhancing the modeling performance. The obtained results indicate the ability of the BS and LUBE methods to estimate the uncertainty bound. The Delta method mostly failed to find the desired coverage due to its narrow PIs. On the other hand, the MVE method, due to its wide bound, did not convey valuable information about uncertainty. According to the obtained results, denoising the input vector could enhance the PI quality in the modeling of the SPI by up to 76%. It was more prominent than reducing the UV for evaporation models, which was observed the most at the Ardabil station, up to 30%. The inherently more random nature of drought than the evaporation process was interpreted as the cause of this reaction. From the results, Urmia station seems the riskiest regarding drought ventures. © 2023 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Drought is a harmful natural disaster with various negative effects on many aspects of life. In this research, short-term meteorological droughts were predicted with hybrid machine learning models using monthly precipitation data (1960–2020 period) of Sakarya Meteorological Station, located in the northwest of Turkey. Standardized precipitation index (SPI), depending only on precipitation data, was used as the drought index, and 1-, 3-, and 6-month time scales for short-term droughts were considered. In the prediction models, drought index was predicted at t + 1 output variable by using t, t − 1, t − 2, and t − 3 input variables. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine regression (SVMR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms were employed as stand-alone machine learning methods. Variation mode decomposition (VMD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) were utilized as pre-processing techniques to create hybrid models. Six different performance criteria were used to assess model performance. The hybrid models used together with the pre-processing techniques were found to be more successful than the stand-alone models. Hybrid VMD-GPR model yielded the best results (NSE = 0.9345, OI = 0.9438, R2 = 0.9367) for 1-month time scale, hybrid VMD-GPR model (NSE = 0.9528, OI = 0.9559, R2 = 0.9565) for 3-month time scale, and hybrid DWT-ANN model (NSE = 0.9398, OI = 0.9483, R2 = 0.9450) for 6-month time scale. Considering the entire performance criteria, it was determined that the decomposition success of VMD was higher than DWT and EMD. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Precipitation deficit can affect different natural resources such as water, soil, rivers and plants, and cause meteorological, hydrological and agricultural droughts. Multivariate drought indexes can theoretically show the severity and weakness of various drought types simultaneously. This study introduces an approach for forecasting joint deficit index (JDI) and multivariate standardized precipitation index (MSPI) by using machine–learning methods and entropy theory. JDI and MSPI were calculated for the 1–12 months’ time window (JDI1–12 and MSPI1–12), using monthly precipitation data. The methods implemented for forecasting are group method of data handling (GMDH), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), least squared support vector machine (LSSVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and ANFIS optimized with three heuristic optimization algorithms, differential evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) as meta-innovative methods (ANFIS-DE, ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO). Monthly precipitation, monthly temperature and previous amounts of the index’s values were used as inputs to the models. Data from 10 synoptic stations situated in the widest climatic zone of Iran (extra arid-cold climate) were employed. Optimal model inputs were selected by gamma test and entropy theory. The evaluation results, which were given using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and Willmott index (WI), show that the machine learning and meta-innovative models can present acceptable forecasts of general drought’s conditions. The algorithms DE, GA and PSO, could improve the ANFIS’s performance by 39.4%, 38.7% and 22.6%, respectively. Among all the applied models, the GMDH shows the best forecasting accuracy with MAE = 0.280, RMSE = 0.374 and WI = 0.955. In addition, the models could forecast MSPI better than JDI in the majority of cases (stations). Among the two methods used to select the optimal inputs, it is difficult to select one as a better input selector, but according to the results, more attention can be paid to entropy theory in drought studies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In order to improve the reliable monitoring and prediction of drought behavior, it is crucial to comprehensively consider composite indices. Initially, four univariate drought indices were evaluated: the Standardized Precipitation Index, the Standardized Soil Moisture Index of the top two layers (SSI1 and SSI2), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index. Subsequently, this paper introduces five composite drought indices: the Multivariate Standardized Drought Index, the modified Aggregate Drought Index, the Joint Drought Deficit Index, the Machine Learning (ML-based) Drought Index (SVMs), and the Artificial Intelligence (AI-based) Drought Index (ANF-PSOs) models based on precipitation (P), soil moisture at two layers (SM1 and SM2), and reference evapotranspiration as input variables. These drought indices are formulated using P-ETref inputs, P-SM1 inputs, and P-SM2 inputs. The study covers 30 main basins classified into six climate zones, including coastal wet, mountain, semi mountain, semi desert, desert, and coastal desert across Iran from 1979 to 2021. The performance of the studied models was evaluated using the correlation coefficient and root mean square error in comparison with SPI at the same time scales as the target model. Drought characteristics, including the number of drought events, duration, frequency, and intensity, were determined for each model at monthly, seasonal, and yearly time scales. The results revealed that the recommended P-SM1 inputs for SVMs and ANF-PSOs models significantly outperformed the MSDIs, modified ADIs, and JDIs models. The results indicated that the introduced composite models effectively captured the comprehensive SM situation without being heavily influenced by individual parameters. The behavioral patterns of these indices remained consistent, except for the specific performance of ETref, which caused some inconsistencies. Moreover, a comparison among different climates revealed that ETref played a prominent role in the discrepancies observed in the output of the composite models, resulting in a strong relationship between P and ETref. Consequently, when constructing composite indices, the information conveyed by ETref was more readily disregarded by JDI and ADI but retained in ANF-PSO. This research sheds light on the mechanisms of these ML-based and AI-based composite approaches in integrating different drought features. It offers valuable insights into the performance of composite drought models and provides benchmarks, particularly in dry climates, to enhance drought monitoring methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In order for plants to respond to specific degrees of moisture stress that affect both vegetative development and crop production, circumstances called 'drought' must exist. It happens when the amount of moisture that can be held in the soil to suit a specific crop's needs is insufficient. India's drought has two main causes: climate change and a lack of surface water supplies. In some cases, it may be able to pinpoint the direct cause of a drought in a specific area, but this is not always the case. Consequently, it is imperative to establish an effective method for communicating the Standardized Precipitation Index SPI data revealing drought indices to farmers and strengthen drought and climate resilience in order to improve all these services in favour of improving agricultural productivity and decreasing food insecurity in India. Understanding past drought experiences with precise indicators is essential to developing future plans and policies in India's agriculture industry. Since this study would aid in India's agricultural development, it is obvious that a standardised drought index must be used to comprehend how frequently droughts are occurring across the country. The major goal of this study is to establish a suitable baseline for drought index forecasting using Standardized Precipitation Index SPI data. As a result, the project's ultimate result would be a knowledge base from which appropriate forecasting tools and distribution networks for farmers might be updated or established. Also, experiment with the logistic regression algorithm to get the best prediction. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Drought as a natural phenomenon has always been a serious threat to regions with hot and dry climates. One of the major effects of drought is the drop in groundwater level. This paper focused on the SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) and SWI (Standardized Water-Level Index) to assess meteorological and hydrological drought, respectively. In the first part, we used different time frames of SPI (3, 6, 12, and 24 months) to investigate drought in Yazd, a dry province in the center of Iran for 29 years (1990–2018). Then, in the second part, the relationship between SPI and SWI was investigated in the three aquifers of Yazd by some rain gauge stations and the closest observation wells to them. In addition to using SPI and SWI, we also used different machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict drought conditions including linear model and six non-linear models of K_Nearest_Neighbors, Gradient_Boosting, Decision_Tree, XGBoost, Random_Forest, and Neural_Net. To evaluate the accuracy of the mentioned models, three statistical indicators including Score, RMSE, and MAE were used. Based on the results of the first part, Yazd province has changed from mild wet to mild drought in terms of meteorological drought (the amount of rainfall according to SPI), and this condition can worsen due to climate change. The models used in ML showed that SPI-6 (score ave = 0.977), SPI-3 (score ave = 0.936), SPI-24 (score ave = 0.571), and SPI-12 (score ave = 0.413) indices had the highest accuracy, respectively. The models of Neural_Net (score ave = 0.964–RMSE ave = 0.020–MAE ave = 0.077) and Gradient_Boosting (score ave = 0.551–RMSE ave = 0.124–MAE ave = 0.248) had the highest and lowest accuracy in prediction of the SPI in all four-time scales. Based on the results of the second part, about the SWI, Random_Forest model (score = 0.929–RMSE = 0.052–MAE = 0.150) and model of Neural_Net (score = 0.755–RMSE = 0.235–MAE = 0.456) had the highest and lowest accuracy, respectively. Also, hydrological drought (reduction of the groundwater level) of the region has been much more severe, and according to the low correlation coefficient of average SPI and SWI (R 2 = 0.14), we found that the uncontrolled pumping wells, as a main factor than a shortage of rainfall, have aggravated the hydrological drought, and this region is at risk of becoming a more arid region in the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Drought is a highly dangerous natural hazard that causes water shortages, crop production losses, and environmental fires. Droughts are distinguished by meteorological metrics such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI). SPI is the most general and simple way to compute its values using only precipitation data. A popular way to determine the SPI is to fit the gamma function to rainfall data. The SPI of 14 sites was computed using monthly rainfall data over 33 years (1990 - 2022). The current study analyzed how well two well-known machine learning models, Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT), predicted the standardized precipitation index (SPI) across several time periods such as (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24) months. The models were built at the Nyaung Oo station in Myanmar's drought-prone central region. Results proved that the proposed models could effectively predict droughts at the Nyaung Oo station. The Decision Tree model and Random Forest model recognized the SPI-12 values of Nyaung Oo station. In 80% of training and 20% of testing datasets, the RF model predicted the SPI better than the DT model, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.19, a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0.04, and the highest coefficient of determination ($R^{\mathbf{2}}$) of 0.97. The measurement accuracy is 0.96. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate assessment of drought occurrences is crucial for mitigating the negative impacts of drought events on groundwater sources, agriculture, and ecosystems. Machine learning algorithms are useful for drought prediction because they are simpler, faster, and require fewer data points than dynamic models. Vegetation can become visibly dry, and water levels in reservoirs and lakes can drop, as a direct result of a drought. In the long run, it may be more expensive to manage effects like subsidence, seawater intrusion, as well as ecosystem damage. The social and economic harm caused by drought can be greatly mitigated if we have the ability to monitor water shortages in near real time as well as provide precise drought forecasting from weeks to seasons. There are a number of ways in which drought indices can be tracked and predicted. Historically, PDSI and SPI have been used to foretell drought zones. Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index) is now being used to make reliable drought forecasts. Index (SPEI) (SPEI). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) are just two examples of the machine learning techniques that are examined to determine how well they work for drought prediction. The purpose of this study is to determine which model (a combination of several lag times) will be most accurate in predicting future values of the standardised precipitation index (SPI) and the standardised precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Using a random forest (RF) model with lag durations of 1-12 months, drought was predicted. The accuracy of SPI and SPEI's predictions will rise when the time frame is extended. SPEI is better than SPI in predicting droughts because its overall accuracy (OA) will rise and its mistakes (i.e., overestimate (OE) and underestimate (UE)) will decline. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - A new version of the fuzzy logic model, called the co-active neuro fuzzy inference system (CANFIS), is introduced for predicting standardized precipitation index (SPI). Multiple scales of drought information at six meteorological stations located in Uttarakhand State, India, are used. Different lead times of SPI were computed for prediction, including 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months, with inputs abstracted by autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial-ACF (PACF) analysis at 5% significance level. The proposed CANFIS model was validated against two models: classical artificial intelligence model (e.g., multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN)) and regression model (e.g., multiple linear regression (MLR)). Several performance evaluation metrices (root mean square error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, coefficient of correlation, and Willmott index), and graphical visualizations (scatter plot and Taylor diagram) were computed for the evaluation of model performance. Results indicated that the CANFIS model predicted the SPI better than the other models and prediction results were different for different meteorological stations. The proposed model can build a reliable expert intelligent system for predicting meteorological drought at multi-time scales and decision making for remedial schemes to cope with meteorological drought at the study stations and can help to maintain sustainable water resources management. © 2020 Malik et al.

AB  - Understanding drought and its trend analysis is becoming more challenging as intensified changes in climate lead to negative impacts on agriculture. A key challenge is to formulate a drought index for developing a drought forecasting model to identify drought severity. This paper focuses on assessing the efficiency of remote sensing and GIS techniques for monitoring the spatiotemporal extent of agricultural drought using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). SPI is the major index to assess the agriculture drought and it is further challenging to select the best scale of SPI calculation on various time scales of 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12- months scale. This research aims to attempt to identify the best SPI scale among 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month scales. A database of SPI is generated (period 1991-2022) from daily gridded precipitation data from the India Meteorological Department Pune for the Jaisalmer region in Rajasthan state of India. Statistical method- Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Anderson-Darling (AD) tests are used to investigate three fitting distribution models (Gamma, Weibull, and Normal Distribution Function) for cumulative precipitation data 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- months scale. In order to pick the optimal time scale, the gamma distribution function is evaluated using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as goodness-of-fit criteria with AIC 1928.68 and BIC 1934.76. In contrast, the machine learning approach of a linear regression model is applied to get the best SPI scale out of 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month scales. In both the statistical method (KS & AD test ) and machine learning approach of linear regression, SPI at a 3-month time scale is selected with a significant mentioned result. The SPI -3 scale validation is done using linear correlation with the daily gridded precipitation dataset, in which SPI at a 3-month time scale is selected as a stronger correlation (0.65) with precipitation i.e. good enough for dry spell Rajasthan state.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate monitoring and forecasting of drought are crucial. They play a vital role in the optimal functioning of irrigation systems, risk management, drought readiness, and alleviation. In this work, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, comprising Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) and Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS), and regression, model including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), were investigated for multi-scalar Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) prediction in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand State, India. The SPI was computed on six different scales, i.e., 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 24-month, by deploying monthly rainfall information of available years. The significant lags as inputs for the MLPNN, CANFIS, and MLR models were obtained by utilizing Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) with a significant level equal to 5% for SPI-1, SPI-3, SPI-6, SPI-9, SPI-12, and SPI-24. The predicted multi-scalar SPI values utilizing the MLPNN, CANFIS, and MLR models were compared with calculated SPI of multi-time scales through different performance evaluation indicators and visual interpretation. The appraisals of results indicated that CANFIS performance was more reliable for drought prediction at Dehradun (3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month scales), Chamoli and Tehri Garhwal (1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month scales), Haridwar and Pauri Garhwal (1-, 3-, 6-, and 9-month scales), Rudraprayag (1-, 3-, and 6-month scales), and Uttarkashi (3-month scale) stations. The MLPNN model was best at Dehradun (1-and 24-month scales), Tehri Garhwal and Chamoli (24-month scale), Haridwar (12-and 24-month scales), Pauri Garhwal (12-month scale), Rudraprayag (9-, 12-, and 24-month), and Uttarkashi (1-and 6-month scales) stations, while the MLR model was found to be optimal at Pauri Garhwal (24-month scale) and Uttarkashi (9-, 12-, and 24-month scales) stations. Furthermore, the modeling approach can foster a straightforward and trustworthy expert intelligent mechanism for projecting multi-scalar SPI and decision making for remedial arrangements to tackle meteorological drought at the stations under study. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This research predicted the meteorological drought of Sakarya province in northwest Türkiye using long short-term memory (LSTM). This deep learning algorithm has gained popularity in prediction studies. The standardized precipitation index (SPI), which can only be derived using precipitation data, was utilized for 1, 3, and 6-month time scales. SPI-1, SPI-3, and SPI-6-month time scales drought data calculated from the monthly precipitation data of the Sakarya Meteorology Station between 1960 and 2020 were taken as input data in the LSTM model. SPI drought data were used between 1960 and 2005 as training data and 2006–2020 as test data. Drought at t+1 output time was predicted using SPI values at t, t-1, t-2, and t-3 lag times as input variables. In addition, the results were compared with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-extreme learning machine (ELM) hybrid model to understand the capabilities of the standalone LSTM prediction model. The LSTM model yielded the best results (MAE = 0.11, NSE = 0.97, R2 = 0.97) for the SPI-1-month time scale and the best results (MAE = 0.18, NSE = 0.92, R2 = 0.94) for 3-month time scale. The EMD-ELM hybrid model yielded the best results (MAE = 0.22, NSE = 0.95, R2 = 0.96) for the SPI-6-month time scale. Due to the high performance of this study's proposed standalone LSTM model, it was concluded that drought time series do not need to be subjected to pre-processing techniques. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Reliable drought prediction plays a significant role in drought management. Applying machine learning models in drought prediction is getting popular in recent years, but applying the stand-alone models to capture the feature information is not sufficient enough, even though the general performance is acceptable. Therefore, the scholars tried the signal decomposition algorithm as a data pre-processing tool, and coupled it with the stand-alone model to build ‘decomposition-prediction’ model to improve the performance. Considering the limitations of using the single decomposition algorithm, an ‘integration-prediction’ model construction method is proposed in this study, which deeply combines the results of multiple decomposition algorithms. The model tested three meteorological stations in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, China, where the short-term meteorological drought is predicted from 1960 to 2019. The meteorological drought index selects the Standardized Precipitation Index on a 12-month time scale (SPI-12). Compared with stand-alone models and ‘decomposition-prediction’ models, the ‘integration-prediction’ models present higher prediction accuracy, smaller prediction error and better stability in the results. This new ‘integration-prediction’ model provides attractive value for drought risk management in arid regions. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Drought, as a phenomenon that causes significant damage to agriculture and water resources, has increased across the globe due to climate change. Hence, scientists are attracted to developing drought prediction models for mitigation strategies. Different drought indices (DIs) have been proposed for drought monitoring during the past few decades, most of which are probabilistic, highly stochastic, and non-linear. The present study inspected the capability of various machine learning (ML) models, including artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) as original predictive models and optimized by two selected algorithms, namely, particle swarm optimization (SVR-PSO) and response surface method (SVR-RSM) to predict the meteorological drought indices of standardized precipitation index (SPI), percentage of normal precipitation (PN), effective drought index (EDI), and modified China-Z index (MCZI) on a monthly time scale. A novel model named SVR-RMS is introduced by using two calibrating processes given from RSM with two inputs and the SVR by predicted data handled with RSM given from the first calibrating procedure. For evaluating the models, different meteorological input variables in the period 1981–2020 were considered from 11 synoptic stations in arid and semi-arid climates of Iran, which frequently experience droughts. The SPI showed the highest and lowest correlation with MCZI (0.71) and EDI (0.34), respectively. The results of testing dataset (2011–2020) indicated that the SVR-RSM produced superior abilities for both accuracy and tendency compared to other models, while the SVR-PSO model is better than the ANN and SVR. The worst results of drought prediction were obtained for EDI. However, all models provided the acceptable EDI prediction in the high-temperature station of Ahvaz in the south of the country. Application of SVR-RSM as a novel hybrid model can be suggested for predicting the DIs on a short time scale in arid and semi-arid areas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Over years, natural calamities like drought have taken a huge toll on human life and resources. As the prediction methods increase, the effects of natural calamities can be reduced to an extent by preplanning and providing warnings to the people. Metrological drought indices like standardized precipitation index and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index are used to identify drought and its severity level. By forecasting these indices, the occurrences of drought are predicted using the prediction models which help the society to take preventive measures due to the effect of drought. Many research works on prediction majorly focused on statistical methods such as Holt–Winters and ARIMA, but these methods lack accuracy to provide long-term forecasts. However, with advances in the area of machine learning especially artificial neural networks and deep neural networks, there seems to be a method to predict drought in the long term with a good accuracy. Long short-term memory is used in recurrent neural network to predict the drought indices which handle the real-time nonlinear data well and good that can help authorities better prepare and mitigate natural disasters. In this paper, we compare the 1-, 6- and 12-month prediction of the ARIMA statistical model with LSTM using multivariate input in hopes of bettering said performance. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A simultaneous survey of several types of droughts, such as meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, economic, and social droughts, is possible by using the multivariate standardized precipitation index (MSPI). In this study, the accuracy of four artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including the generalized regression neural network (GRNN), least-square support vector machine (LSSVM), group method of data handling (GMDH), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems with fuzzy C-means clustering (ANFIS-FCM), were investigated in forecasting the MSPI of three synoptic stations (Jolfa, Kerman, and Tehran) located in the arid-cold climate of Iran. The data used was monthly precipitation and belongs to a 30-year period (1988-2017). MSPI values were calculated in five time windows, including the following: 3-6 (MSPI3-6), 6-12 (MSPI6-12), 3-12 (MSPI3-12), 12-24 (MSPI12-24), and 24-48 (MSPI24-48). The period of 1988-2016 was considered for training (75%) and testing (25%), and 2017 (12 months) was used for long-term forecasting. The methods were evaluated by the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott index (WI), and Taylor diagram. In the short-term forecasting phase, results showed that the methods had their best performances in forecasting multivariate drought types of groundwater hydrology-economic-social (MSPI24-48), agricultural-groundwater hydrology (MSPI12-24), surface hydrology-agricultural (MSPI6-12), soil moisture-surface hydrology-agricultural (MSPI3-12), and soil moisture-surface hydrology (MSPI3-6), respectively. Also, among the mentioned methods, the weakest accuracy was reported for GRNN with an RMSE=0.673, MAE=0.499, and WI=0.750 (related to MSPI3-6 of the Kerman station); the most accurate performance resulted from the GMDH with RMSE=0.097, MAE=0.074, and WI=0.989 (related to MSPI24-48 of the Jolfa station). In spite of the acceptable performance of the models in short-term forecasting, by increasing the forecasting horizons, the models' errors were increased in the long-term forecasting phase. The models could have acceptable long-term forecasts for just two months (or in some exceptional cases, three months) ahead. Further, according to the investigations, it can be shown that the methods show better performances in mountainous arid-cold regions, compared to desert arid-cold regions. As a theoretical study of multivariate drought forecasting, the AIs have promising results, and this research can be extended for the other regions.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Drought is one of the important and costliest disaster all over the world. With the accelerated progress of climate change, its frequency of occurrence and negative impacts are rapidly increasing. It is crucial to initiate and sustain an early warning system to monitor and predict the possible impacts of future droughts. Recently, with the rise of data driven models, various case studies are conducted by using Machine Learning algorithms instead of using pure statistical approaches. The main goal of this paper is to conduct a drought forecasting study for a weather station located in Marmara Region. For that purpose, firstly, widely used univariate drought index, Standardized Precipitation Index is calculated for Bursa station. Thereafter, both the historical information retrieved from time series data and its wavelet transformation are considered to investigate Nonlinear Auto-Regressive and Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with External Input (NARX) type Neural Network (NN) models. According to a pool of Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) tests, the forecasting performance of the models with various number of hidden neurons are compared. The recent findings of the study showed that considering the data with its wavelet transformation under (NARX-NN) has benefits to increase the capacity of forecasting the drought index. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - There is a trend in using Artificial Intelligence methods as simulation tools in different aspects of hydrology, including river discharge simulations, drought predictions, and crop yield simulations. The motivation of this work was to assess two various concepts in applying these methods in simulations and projections of hydrological drought. In this study, Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) was simulated and projected using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and meteorological drought indicators (the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)) were selected as predictors. A direct approach (directly simulating and projecting SRI) and an indirect approach (simulating and projecting river discharge, then calculating SRI) were assessed. Our results show that the indirect approach performs better than the direct approach in simulations of SRI in four discharge stations in the Odra River Basin (a transboundary river basin in Central Europe) from 2000 to 2019. Moreover, a considerable difference between these two approaches was detected in projections of hydrological drought under the RCP8.5 emission scenario for two horizons (near future: 2021–2040, and far future: 2041–2060). Based on the run theory, both approaches show somewhat similar drought conditions for future projections. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drought forecasting provides an early warning for the effective management of water resources to avoid or mitigate drought damage. In this study, the prediction of droughts is carried out in the department of Alibori in Benin republic using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) where two Machine Learning approaches were used to set up the drought prediction models which were Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST). The performance of these models was reported using metrics such as: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean absolute error (MAE). The results revealed that XGBOOST models gave better prediction performance for SPI 3, 6, 12 with coefficients of determination of 0.89, 0.83 and 0.99, respectively. The square root mean square error (RMSE) of the models gives 0.29, 0.40 and 0.07, respectively.

AB  - In agroecosystems, drought is a critical climatic phenomenon that affects evapotranspiration and induces water stress in plants. The objective in this study was to characterize and forecast water stress in the Hyderabad region of India using artificial intelligence models. The monthly precipitation data for the period 1982–2021 was characterized by the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and modeled using the classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and artificial intelligence (AI), i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) model. The results show that on the short-term SPI3 time scale the studied region experienced extreme water deficit in 1983, 1992, 1993, 2007, 2015, and 2018, while on the mid-term SPI6 time scale, 1983, 1991, 2011, and 2016 were extremely dry. In addition, the prediction of drought at both SPI3 and SPI6 time scales by AI models outperformed the classical ARIMA models in both, training and validation data sets. Among applied models, the SVR model performed better than other models in modeling and predicting drought (confirmed by root mean square error—RMSE), while the Diebold–Mariano test confirmed that SVR output was significantly superior. A reduction in the prediction error of SVR by 48% and 32% (vs. ARIMA), and by 21% and 26% (vs. ANN) was observed in the test data sets for both SPI3 and SPI6 time scales. These results may be due to the ability of the SVR model to account for the nonlinear and complex patterns in the input data sets against the classical linear ARIMA model. These results may contribute to more sustainable and efficient management of water resources/stress in cropping systems. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Drought modeling is vital for designing and managing water resource systems due to its significant effects on agriculture and other components of the environment. This study evaluates the prediction accuracy of two newly developed heuristic methods, optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) and dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) in drought modeling based on four standard precipitation indexes (SPI), i.e., SPI3, SPI6, SPI9 and SPI12 calculated for three meteorological stations of Pakistan. The prediction capability of the two methods is tested using the different time lag input combinations of each drought index and compared with multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS). For the SPI3, SPI6, and SPI12 drought indexes, it was found that the DENFIS model provided better accuracy than the OP-ELM and MARS models. However, in the case of SPI6, the OP-ELM model performed better than the other models. The effect of periodicity on the prediction accuracy of the models is also evaluated. It was found that adding periodicity as inputs for models generally gave good forecasting results; however, importing this component negatively affects models’ accuracy in some cases. The best DENFIS model improved the accuracy of the OP-ELM by 8.35%, 6.06% and 2.51% predicting SPI3, SPI6, and SPI12 of Drosh Station with respect to root mean square error criterion, respectively. This study also demonstrated that the DENFIS heuristic models which have not been previously used for this issue generally provided more accurate predictions than the other models in drought prediction. © 2023 THE AUTHORS

AB  - Drought is a natural hazard driven by extreme macroclimatic variability, and generally resulting in serious damage to the environment over a sizable area. Accurate, reliable, and timely forecasting of drought behavior plays a key role in early warning of drought management. In this study, a hybrid hidden Markov model coupled with multivariate copula (HMC) is proposed for probabilistic drought forecast. It is an extension of the regular hidden Markov model (HMM) in which the mixture distribution for each forecast is a weighted combination of posterior copula conditional distributions, which are allowed to vary with different predictors. Bayesian inference is used to optimize model structure and parameters. The cascaded sampling procedure is used to obtain conditional probability of a pair copula. The HMC model is performed for multistep meteorological drought forecast at the stations of Hanchuan and Tianmen, China, with the widely used Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) time series. HMM, artificial neural network (ANN), and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) drought forecasting are also implemented for comparison. Results demonstrate that HMC drought forecast is much more accurate than HMM, ARMA, and ANN for point forecasts as well as interval forecasts. This study is of great significance for understanding drought uncertainty and extending drought early warning. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Climate change has caused droughts to increase in frequency and severity worldwide, which has attracted scientists to create drought prediction models to mitigate the impacts of droughts. One of the most important challenges in addressing droughts is developing accurate models to predict their discrete characteristics, i.e., occurrence, duration, and severity. The current research examined the performance of several different machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and M5P Tree in forecasting the most widely used drought measure, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), at both discrete time scales (SPI 3, SPI 6). The drought model was developed utilizing rainfall data from two stations in India (i.e., Angangaon and Dahalewadi) for 2000–2019, wherein the first 14 years are employed for model training, while the remaining six years are employed for model validation. The subset regression analysis was performed on 12 different input combinations to choose the best input combination for SPI 3 and SPI 6. The sensitivity analysis was carried out on the given best input combination to find the most effective parameter for forecasting. The performance of all the developed models for ANN (4, 5), ANN (5, 6), ANN (6, 7), and M5P models was assessed through the different statistical indicators, namely, MAE, RMSE, RAE, RRSE, and r. The results revealed that SPI (t-1) is the most sensitive parameters with highest values of β = 0.916, 1.017, respectively, for SPI-3 and SPI-6 prediction at both stations on the best input combinations i.e., combination 7 (SPI-1/SPI-3/SPI-4/SPI-5/SPI-8/SPI-9/SPI-11) and combination 4 (SPI-1/SPI-2/SPI-6/SPI-7) based on the higher values of R2 and Adjusted R2 while the lowest values of MSE values. It is clear from the performance of models that the M5P model has higher r values and lesser RMSE values as compared to ANN (4, 5), ANN (5, 6), and ANN (6, 7) models. Therefore, the M5P model was superior to other developed models at both stations. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - With the advancement of computer science, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being incorporated into many fields to increase prediction performance. Disaster management is one of the main fields embracing the techniques of AI. It is essential to forecast the occurrence of disasters in advance to take the necessary mitigation steps and reduce damage to life and property. Therefore, many types of research are conducted to predict such events due to climate change in advance using hydrological, mathematical, and AI-based approaches. This paper presents a comparison of three major accepted AI-based approaches in flood and drought forecasting. In this study, fluvial floods are measured by the runoff change in rivers whereas meteorological droughts are measured using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM), and Wavelet decomposition functions combined with the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WANFIS) are compared in flood and drought forecasting, with five statistical performance criteria and accepted flood and drought indicators used for comparison, extending to two climatic regions: arid and tropical. The results suggest that the CNN performs best in flood forecasting with WANFIS for meteorological drought forecasting, regardless of the climate of the region under study. Besides, the results demonstrate the increased accuracy of the CNN in applications with multiple features in the input. © 2021

AB  - Globally, an increase in the occurrence of droughts may be due to the effects of climate change on rainfall patterns. Drought prediction based on historical rainfall behavior can be very useful in sectors where water is a critical element, such as rain-fed agriculture. Therefore, drought classification and characterization based on drought index prediction models could aid in mitigating their negative effects in such water-sensitive sectors. The primary goal of this paper was to test a Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network as a model to forecast the monthly Standardized Precipitation Index in north-central México using rainfall data from the 1964– 2014 period. The model was obtained using the Hyperbolic Tangent activation function and the optimization method from the Adaptive Moment Estimation algorithm. The model used a 26-12-1 network architecture with 4 weights and 365 trainable parameters. The scatter plot analysis between predicted and observed Standardized Precipitation Index values for the test dataset resulted in a Coefficient of Determination between 0.84 and 0.88. Based on quantitative statistics averaged across the test set, the Artificial Network Model performed substantially well in predicting the Standardized Precipitation Index at the four studied regions. This was confirmed by an all-region average value of the performance statistics Mean Absolute Error (0.081), Mean Square Error (0.014) and the Coefficient of Determination (0.867). We conclude that the Artificial Network models developed and tested in this research provided adequate monthly Standardized Precipitation Index skills for the analyzed stations in the studied territory © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 4.0 International license

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop mathematical models based on artificial intelligence: Models based on the support vectors regression (SVR) for drought forecast in the Ansegmir watershed (Upper Moulouya, Morocco). This study focuses on the prediction of the temporal aspect of the two drought indices (standardized precipitation index - SPI and standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index - SPEI) using six hydro-climatic variables relating to the period 1979-2013. The model SVR3-SPI: RBF, ε = 0.004, C = 20 and γ = 1.7 for the index SPI, and the model SVR3-SPEI: RBF ε = 0.004, C = 40 and γ = 0.167 for the SPEI index are significantly better in comparison to other models SVR1, SVR2 and SVR4. The SVR model for the SPI index gave a correlation coefficient of R = 0.92, MSE = 0.17 and MAE = 0.329 for the learning phase and R = 0.90, MSE = 0.18 and MAE = 0.313 for the testing phase. As for the SPEI index, the overlay is slightly poorer only in the case of the SPI index between the observed values and the predicted ones by the SVR model. It shows a very small gap between the observed and predicted values. The correlation coefficients R = 0.88 for the learning, R = 0.86 for testing remain higher and corresponding to a quadratic error average MSE = 0.21 and MAE = 0.351 for the learning and MSE = 0.21 and MAE = 0.350 for the testing phase. The prediction of drought by SVR model remain useful and would be extremely important for drought risk management. © 2021. The Authors.

AB  - East Nusa Tenggara Province is one of the most vulnerable regions in Indonesia to drought. Drought prediction is definitely needed as a mitigation action to minimize the risk of drought. However, a sparse dataset has led to difficulties in accurately predicting future droughts in areas without meteorological stations, and hence a dataset with a finer resolution is required. This research investigates the performance of a 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) to predict drought. CART and Random Forest are applied as the classification methods. Using several predictors, the analysis finds that CART has lower predictability than Random Forest. The average accuracy of the prediction using Random Forest reaches 100% with an average Area Under Curve (AUC) of about 0.8. The analysis also shows that predictions using the MERRA-2 dataset lead to higher accuracy and AUC than those using the TRMM. Therefore, using the MERRA-2 dataset predicted by Random Forest can be an optimal way to predict drought in East Nusa Tenggara. The methods confirmed that average soil surface temperature (day and night), Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are strong predictors of drought. The performance of CART and Random Forest is improved with the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE). The techniques described: • translate drought information and predictors of drought into a base classifier that optimizes the AUC; • allow drought to be predicted for many grid points efficiently and with high accuracy; and • are computationally efficient and easy to implement. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Agriculture, meteorological, and hydrological drought is a natural hazard which affects ecosystems in the central India of Maharashtra state. Due to limited historical data for drought monitoring and forecasting available in the central India of Maharashtra state, implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms could allow for the prediction of future drought events. In this paper, we have focused on the prediction accuracy of meteorological drought in the semi-arid region based on the standardized precipitation index (SPI) using the random forest (RF), random tree (RT), and Gaussian process regression (GPR-PUK kernel) models. A different combination of machine learning models and variables has been performed for the forecasting of metrological drought based on the SPI-6 and 12 months. Models were developed using monthly rainfall data for the period of 2000–2019 at two meteorological stations, namely, Karanjali and Gangawdi, each representing a geographical region of Upper Godavari river basin area in the central India of Maharashtra state which frequently experiences droughts. Historical data from the SPI from 2000 to 2013 was processed to train the model into machine learning model, and the rest of the 2014 to 2019-year data were used for testing to forecast the SPI and metrological drought. The mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), adjusted R2, Mallows’ (Cp), Akaike’s (AIC), Schwarz’s (SBC), and Amemiya’s PC were used to identify the best combination input model and best subregression analysis for both stations of SPI-6 and 12. The correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative squared error (RRSE) were used to perform evaluation for SPI-6 and 12 months of both stations with RF, RT, and GPR-PUK kernel models during the training and testing scenarios. The results during testing phase revealed that the RF was found as the best model in forecasting droughts with values of r, MAE, RMSE, RAE (%), and RRSE (%) being 0.856, 0.551, 0.718, 74.778, and 54.019, respectively, for SPI-6 while 0.961, 0.361, 0.538, 34.926, and 28.262, respectively, for SPI-12 scales at Gangawdi station. Further, the respective values of evaluators at Karanjali station were 0.913 and 0.966, 0.541 and 0.386, 0.604 and 0.589, 52.592 and 36.959, and 42.315 and 31.394 for PUK kernel and RT models, respectively, during SPI-6 and SPI-12. Machine learning models are potential drought warning techniques because they take less time, have fewer inputs, and are less sophisticated than dynamic or scientific models. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study aims to develop a framework to detect the drought risk using the Machine Learning (ML) and vegetation index data extracted from LANDSAT 8 OLI images. Experiments were carried out through three stages: (1) data acquisition, (2) data preprocessing, and (3) analysis and modeling. The vegetation indices in these experiment are NDVI, TCI, VCI, VHI, and SAVI. The Meteorology data are Standardized Precipitation Index three month (SPI-3) data. The correlation analysis was made using Pearson Correlation and data classification was done using ML algorithms: K-NN, CART, RF, SVM and LDA. The results show that the vegetation index data formed a cluster pattern. The index vegetation had a positive correlation, which means that the higher the health of the vegetation canopy. This indices show the performance classification using ML methods for drought risk areas indicate that the ratio of valid vegetation indices with the total amount of data analyzed varies between 98% - 100%. The Cohen's Kappa Statistic test is between 0.8 - 1, and the Logarithmic Loss performance is between 0.037 - 0, 17.  © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Compound extremes can be expressed as the joint distribution or dynamic interaction of multiple variables and the interdependence of several extremes that have major effects on the agricultural sector. Analysis of these compound extremes in space-time varying domains is a challenging task for climate experts. It is even difficult to forecast such compound extremes in future climate when several widely accepted global climate models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs) are available. Thus, an attempt is made to develop a compound extreme index considering precipitation, temperature, and runoff, with a specific focus on promoting sustainable water resource management, particularly for the benefit of the agricultural sector. This work presents a new outlook on the modeling framework for compound drought and hot extremes (CDHE) by developing the Standardized Compound Extreme Event Index (SCEEI), and highlights their time-varying evaluation (trend and prediction) along with severity assessments. The SCEEI is derived using three individual indices: Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Runoff Index (SRI), and Standardized Temperature Index (STI), which are obtained from three physical variables (precipitation, runoff, and temperature) followed by multivariate Gaussian distribution. The applicability of the SCEEI is explained with a case study on the Brahmani and Baitarani rivers of eastern India, aiming at the modeling of dry and hot extremes at a regional scale. Further, the time-varying evaluation of CDHE events - the projection of the extremes - is studied in machine learning (ML)-based ensemble future. Random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) MLs are employed to derive ensemble future from seven RCM models of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The linear scaling approach (LSA)-based bias-corrected data were used as input for the ensembling process. The RF-predicted ensembles performed statistically better for the study area. The extreme events and their severities are further assessed in RF-predicted future ensembles. The two-tail-based Mann-Kendall test, followed by Sen's slope estimator, is used to investigate the trend-based time-varying evaluation of CDHE events. The notable conclusion drawn from this study is that the severity and frequency of CDHE events are increasing in the ensemble future climate, particularly in representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. The developed multivariate framework might allow new prospects for suitable statistical analysis techniques for dependent compound extremes in climate-related studies and hydrology, which is further necessary for applying an adaptation strategy to boost resilience and adapt society for future climatic extremes. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Measured climate data are often scarce and expensive to collect through a network of measurement points. There are various reanalysis products that can be used in certain regions in studies concerned with drought monitoring. This study aimed at assessment of the adequacy of using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP-CFSR) rainfall data and the ERA5 rainfall data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in monitoring meteorological drought over the Upper Olifants sub-basin, South Africa. A comparison was made between the observed rainfall data and the two reanalysis products based on the Mean Error (ME), the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and percentage of bias (PBIAS). The data were also used in computing and comparing the results of the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The CFSR were found to underestimate rainfall amounts, while the ERA5 overestimated the rainfall amounts except during winter. The ERA5 showed a better correlation which was R2 = 0.78 when compared to the one for the CFSR, R2 = 0.57. Also, the NSE, ME and PBIAS for the ERA5 products were generally better in almost all-time scales. The three products detected one of the major droughts but the CFSR were unable to detect the second major drought in the study area during the chosen study period. The study concludes that the ERA5 is a better product for meteorological drought monitoring in the study area and can be useful in predicting meteorological drought using artificial intelligence due to the spatiotemporal resolution of the product. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - An effective water resources management requires accurate predictions of possible risks. Drought is one of the most devastating phenomena that has a certain risk of occurrence. Understanding the variability of the drought indices is of great importance in determining the spatiotemporal behavior of the drought phenomenon. Moreover, determination of the variability and short-term prediction of the drought indices enables us to take necessary steps in hydrological and agricultural issues. In this study, drought indices have been predicted via Support Vector Regression, SVR. This method originated from a linear regression method in a high dimensional feature space. SVR necessitates a special input matrix. In this study, this matrix has been constructed on the basis of Chaotic Approach, CA. Commonly used drought indices are used in the prediction stage. These indices consist of monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI, Palmer Hydrological Drought Index, PHDI, Palmer Z-Index, ZNDX, Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index, PMDI, and Standard Precipitation Index, SPI. One-step ahead prediction has been realized for a 36-month period. Most results show that predictions of the drought indices using SVR are quite promising. © 2020 Ö. Baydaroğlu Yeşilköy, K. Koçak, L.

AB  - Drought is among the most common but least understood phenomena that affect an increasing number of people in the context of climate change. To understand underlying drought dynamics affecting the local agricultural production in Botswana, a broad database comprising climatic and remote-sensing data together with socioeconomic indicators was set up. A data science approach that includes statistical and machine learning methods was chosen to retrieve information applicable in a drought early-warning system. The aim of the study was to examine how data science can contribute to the understanding of drought risk through the integration of various data sources. Different regression models (including linear and OLS) were applied. Naïve Bayes classification and Random Forest regression were included, as was a change point analysis. The impacts of two variables in particular, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), on crop productivity could be observed, highlighting possible national and regional thresholds. Further development of the early warning system, including validation, should be accompanied by ground-truth information and work with local partners. © GI_Forum.All right reserved.

AB  - Accurate prediction of any type of natural hazard is a challenging task. Of all the various hazards, drought prediction is challenging as it lacks a universal definition and is getting adverse with climate change impacting drought events both spatially and temporally. The problem becomes more complex as drought occurrence is dependent on a multitude of factors ranging from hydro-meteorological to climatic variables. A paradigm shift happened in this field when it was found that the inclusion of climatic variables in the data-driven prediction model improves the accuracy. However, this understanding has been primarily using statistical metrics used to measure the model accuracy. The present work tries to explore this finding using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model. The explainable deep learning model development and comparative analysis were performed using known understandings drawn from physical-based models. The work also tries to explore how the model achieves specific results at different spatio-temporal intervals, enabling us to understand the local interactions among the predictors for different drought conditions and drought periods. The drought index used in the study is Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) at 12 month scales applied for five different regions in New South Wales, Australia, with the explainable algorithm being SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The conclusions drawn from SHAP plots depict the importance of climatic variables at a monthly scale and varying ranges of annual scale. We observe that the results obtained from SHAP align with the physical model interpretations, thus suggesting the need to add climatic variables as predictors in the prediction model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Depending on the severity and spatial-temporal variability, droughts can have a wide range of impacts such as crop failure, water shortages, and food insecurity. Accurate and timely forecasting is necessary to mitigate the hazards of extreme weather events, such as droughts, brought on by climate change. A district like Chitradurga in India, which typically receives around 450-600 mm of annual rainfall, will require advanced drought mitigation strategies and plans before the onset of the drought. This research focuses on 1-step lead time forecasting of meteorological drought episodes making use of the 6-month Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI-6) as indicator. The fine resolution rainfall data (0.25 ×0.25 ) obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department was used to derive the 6-month SPI data of 23 grid stations. The 1-step lead time SPI-6 time series was forecast considering the antecedent SPI-6 time series data as model input. The Mutual Information was used to determine the most relevant input features for drought forecasting. The standard Artificial Neural Network, an advanced machine learning framework - Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and the ensemble learning-based CatBoost Regression and Gradient Tree Boosting paradigms were employed to forecast drought episodes. Error and efficiency metrics were employed for performance evaluation of the simulated models. The multivariate adaptive regression splines and gradient tree boosting forecasts had slightly higher accuracy and lower error rates than the artificial neural network model, which suggests that they may be more reliable for drought forecasting. The root mean square error and normalized Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranges of the multivariate adaptive regression splines model (during test phase) were 0.37-0.54 and 0.78-0.87, respectively. The thematic maps that were created using spatial interpolation of model forecasts from all the stations also confirmed that the district as a whole experienced drought in April 2019.  © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - This study aims to assess the Eastern Black Sea Basin drought conditions. For this purpose, the trend changes in SPI values of 6, 9, 12, and 24 months using innovative trend analysis were examined. Additionally, four machine learning models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, K Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost Regressor, are employed to forecast SPI with rainfall data between 1965 and 2020 from eight rainfall stations. The input data for each model was SPI values from lead times of 1 to 6, resulting into 768 unique scenarios. The ML models estimated SPI values better as the SPI duration increased, with the 24-month SPI showing the highest accuracy. The results of SPI forecast indicated that the optimal model and number of input variables varied for each SPI and station, indicating that further studies are required to improve SPI predictions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Recent meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts in the Mediterranean regions have raised concerns about the impact of climate change. In this study, the meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts were modeled in the Wadi Ouahrane Basin using various machine learning (ML) models and standardized indices of rainfall, evapotranspiration, and runoff (SPI, SPEI, and SRI) at different times scales (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months). The applied ML models were the linear support vector machine (SVM), quadratic SVM, cubic SVM, fine gaussian SVM, medium gaussian SVM, coarse Gaussian SVM, rational quadratic Gaussian process regression (GPR), squared exponential GPR, Matern 5/2 GPR, exponential GPR, bagged tree, and boosted tree. Moreover, the hybrid models acquired by combining these ML models with wavelet transform were evaluated. The performance of the models was analyzed using statistical criteria such as root mean square error, determination coefficient, and mean absolute error. As a result, wavelet-GPR models showed the most promising results in estimating SPI, SPEI, and SRI values. The values for SPI (R 2 of train: 0.393; and test: 0.351), SPEI (R 2 of train: 0.809; test: 0.746), and SRI (R 2 of train: 0.999; test: 0.808) indicate monthly time scale. Additionally, for the time periods of 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months, the predictions for SPI, SPEI, and SRI generally obtain R 2 of train 0.99 and test 0.95 values. Moreover, it was determined that wavelet-based ML models, established with inputs divided into three subcomponents with Daubechies mother wavelet, showed superior results than standalone ML models. The study results could guide decision-makers and planners in developing drought risk management and mitigation strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Drought, as a natural disaster, has significant negative consequences and directly impacts living organisms. Drought forecasting commonly relies on various drought indices, with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) being widely used. In this study, we propose a novel approach to estimate SPI values at 3- and 6-month lead times with high accuracy. This novel method introduces a phase transfer entropy (pTE) technique that analyzes time-shifted data matrices and the connectivity of SPI-3 and SPI-6 data. By maximizing the information flow between these data points, the most suitable time index (t − n) for input data in forecasting models is determined. This approach, not previously explored in the literature, forms the basis for predicting SPI values effectively. Machine learning algorithms, in combination with the Tunable Q Factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT) optimized by the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm, are employed to predict SPI values using the identified input data. The TQWT method generates subband signals, which are then estimated using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and the Gaussian Process Regression Model (GPR). To evaluate the performance of the proposed GWO-TQWT-ML models, the subband data derived from the SPI is also estimated using ANN, GPR, and SVR models with the Empirical Mode Decomposition and Variational Mode Decomposition methods. Additionally, non-preprocessed SPI data is estimated independently using ANN, GPR, and SVR models. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the pTE-GWO-TQWT-ML models over other methods. Among these models, the pTE-GWO-TQWT-GPR model stands out with the best prediction performance, surpassing both the pTE-GWO-TQWT-ANN and pTE-GWO-TQWT-SVR models. The pTE-GWO-TQWT-GPR model yielded determination coefficient (R2) values for SPI-6 data as follows: 0.8039 for one-input, 0.9987 for two-input, and 0.9998 for three-input one ahead prediction, respectively; 0.9907 for two-input two ahead prediction; and 0.9722 for two-input three ahead prediction. For SPI-3 data, using the pTE-GWO-TQWT-GPR model, the R2 values were as follows: 0.6805 for one-input, 0.9982 for two-input, 0.9996 for three-input one ahead prediction, 0.9843 for two-input two ahead prediction, 0.9535 for two-input three ahead prediction, 0.9963 for three-input two ahead prediction, and 0.9826 for three-input three ahead prediction. Overall, this study presents a robust method, the pTE-GWO-TOWT-GPR model, for the time series estimation of SPI data, enabling high-performance drought prediction. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Short-range predictions of crop yield provide valuable insights for agricultural resource management and likely economic impacts associated with low yield. Such predictions are difficult to achieve in regions that lack extensive observational records. Herein, we demonstrate how a number of basic or readily available input data can be used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to provide months-ahead predictions of cotton yield for a case study in Menemen Plain, Turkey. We use limited reported yield (13 years) along cumulative precipitation, cumulative heat units, two meteorologically-based drought indices (Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)), and three remotely-sensed vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)) as ANN inputs. Results indicate that, when EVI is combined with the preceding 12-month SPEI, it has better sensitivity to cotton yield than other indicators. The ANN model predicted cotton yield four months before harvest with R2 >0.80, showing potential as a yield prediction tool. We discuss the effects of different combinations of input data (explanatory variables), dataset size, and selection of training data to inform future applications of ANN for early prediction of cotton yield in data-scarce regions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Recurring drought has caused large crop yield losses in Australia during past decades. Long-term drought forecasting is of great importance for the development of risk management strategies. Recently, large-scale climate drivers (e.g. El Niño-Southern Oscillation) have been demonstrated as useful in the application of drought forecasting. Machine learning-based models that use climate drivers as input are commonly adopted to provide drought forecasts as these models are easy to develop and require less information compared to physical-based models. However, few machine learning-based models have been developed to forecast drought conditions during growing season across all Australian cropping areas. In this study, we developed a growing season (Apr.-Nov.) meteorological drought forecasting model for each climate gauging location across the Australian wheatbelt based on multiple lagged (past) large-scale climate indices and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used as the response variable to measure the degree of meteorological drought. Results showed that the RF model could provide satisfactory drought forecasts in the eastern areas of the wheatbelt with Pearson's correlation coefficient r > 0.5 and normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) < 23%. Forecasted drought maps matched well with observed drought maps for three representative periods. We identified NINO3.4 sea surface temperature and Multivariate ENSO Index as the most influential indices dominating growing season drought conditions across the wheatbelt. In addition, lagged impacts of large-scale climate drivers on growing season drought conditions were long-lasting and the indices in previous year could also potentially affect drought conditions during current year. As large-scale climate indices are readily available and can be rapidly used to feed data driven models, we believe the proposed meteorological drought forecasting models can be easily extended to other regions to provide drought outlooks which can help mitigate adverse drought impacts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrological drought forecasting is a key component in water resources modeling as it relates directly to water availability. It is crucial in managing and operating dams, which are constructed in rivers. In this study, multiple extreme learning machines (ELMs) are utilized to forecast hydrological drought. For this purpose, the standardized hydrological drought index (SHDI) and standardized precipitation index (SPI) are computed for 1 and 3 aggregated months. Two scenarios are considered, namely, using SHDI in previous months as the input, and using SHDI and SPI in previous months as the input. Considering these scenarios and two timescales (1 and 3 months), 12 input–output combinations are generated. Then, five different ELMs and support vector machine models are used to predict the SHDI on both timescales. For preprocessing of the data, the wavelet is hybridized with the models, leading to 144 different models. The results indicate that ELMs are capable of forecasting SHDI with high precision. The self-adaptive differential evolution ELM outperforms the other models and the wavelet has a highly positive effect on the model performance, especially in error reduction. In general, using ELMs in hydrological drought forecasting is promising and this model can feasibly be used for this purpose. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This study introduces and validates an artificial intelligence (AI)–based downscaling method for Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPI) in the northwest of Iran, utilizing PERSSIAN-CDR data and MODIS-derived drought-dependent variables. The correlation between SPI and two drought-dependent variables at a spatial resolution of 0.25° from 2000 to 2015 served as the basis for predicting SPI values at a finer spatial resolution of 0.05° for the period spanning 2016 to 2021. Shallow AI models (Support Vector Regression, Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System, Feedforward Neural Network) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning method are employed for downscaling, followed by an ensemble post-processing technique for shallow AI models. Validation against rain gauge data indicates that all methods improve SPI simulation compared to PERSIANN-CDR products. The ensemble technique excels by 20% and 25% in the training and test phases, respectively, achieving the mean Determination Coefficient (DC) score of 0.67 in the validation phase. Results suggest that the deep learning LSTM method is less suitable for limited observed data compared to ensemble techniques. Additionally, the proposed methodology successfully detects approximately 80% of drought conditions. Notably, SPI-6 outperforms other temporal scales. This study advances the understanding of AI-driven downscaling for SPI, emphasizing the efficacy of ensemble approaches and providing valuable insights for regions with limited observational data. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Drought is one of the major global natural disasters, and appropriate monitoring systems are essential to reveal drought trends. In this regard, deep learning is a very promising approach for characterizing the non-linear nature of drought factors. We used multi-source remote sensing data such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data to integrate drought impact factors such as precipitation, vegetation, temperature, and soil moisture. The application of convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) to construct an integrated drought monitoring model was proposed and tested, using the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as an example. To better compare the monitoring performance of ConvLSTM models, three other classical deep learning models and three classical machine learning models were also used for comparison. The results show that the composite drought index (CDI) output by the ConvLSTM model had a consistent high correlation with the drought rating of the multi-scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The correlation coefficients between the CDI and the multi-scale standardized precipitation index (SPI) were all above 0.5 (p < 0.01), which was highly significant, and the correlation coefficient between CDI-1 and the monthly soil relative humidity at a 10 cm depth was above 0.45 (p < 0.01), which was well correlated. In addition, the spatial distribution of the CDI-6 simulated by the model was highly correlated with the degree of drought expressed by the SPEI-6 observations at the stations. This study provides a new approach for integrated regional drought monitoring. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Drought forecasting is a vital task for sustainable development and water resource management. Emerging machine learning techniques could be used to develop precise drought forecasting models. However, they need to be explicit and simple enough to secure their implementation in practice. This article introduces a novel explicit model, called multi-objective multi-gene genetic programming (MOMGGP), for meteorological drought forecasting that addresses both the accuracy and simplicity of the model applied. The proposed model considers two objective functions: (i) root mean square error and (ii) expressional complexity during its evolution. While the former is used to increase the model accuracy at the training phase, the latter is assigned to decrease the model complexity and achieve parsimony conditions. The model evolution and verification procedure were demonstrated using the standardized precipitation index obtained for Burdur City, Turkey. The comparison with benchmark genetic programming (GP) and multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) models showed that MOMGGP provides the same forecasting accuracy with more parsimony conditions. Thus, it is suggested to utilize the model for practical meteorological drought forecasting. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Hydrological droughts are characterized based on their duration, severity, and magnitude. Among the most critical factors, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff  are essential in modeling the droughts. In this study, three indices of drought, i.e., Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI), and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), are modeled using Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and M5 model trees (MT). The results indicate that SPI delivered higher accuracy. Moreover, MT model performed better in predicting SSI by a CC of 0.8195 and a RMSE of 0.8186.

AB  - Drought is a natural hazard which affects ecosystems in the eastern Mediterranean. However, limited historical data for drought monitoring and forecasting are available in the eastern Mediterranean. Thus, implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms could allow for the prediction of future drought events. In this context, the main goals of this research were to capture agricultural and hydrological drought trends by using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and to assess the applicability of four ML algorithms (bagging (BG), random subspace (RSS), random tree (RT), and random forest (RF)) in predicting drought events in the eastern Mediterranean based on SPI-3 and SPI-12. The results reveal that hydrological drought (SPI-12, −24) was more severe over the study area, where most stations showed a significant (p < 0.05) negative trend. The accuracy of ML algorithms in drought prediction varied in relation to the implementation stage. In the training stage, RT outperformed the other algorithms (Root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.3, Correlation Coefficient (r) = 0.97); the performance of the algorithms can be ranked as follows: RT > RF > BG > RSS for both SPI-3 and SPI-12. In the testing stage, both the BG and RF algorithms had the highest correlation r (observed vs. predicted) (0.58–0.64) and lowest RMSE (0.68–0.88). In contrast, the lowest correlation r (observed vs. predicted) (0.3–0.41) and highest RMSE (0.94–1.10) was calculated for the RT algorithm. However, BG was more dynamic in drought capturing, with the lowest RMSE and highest correlation. In the validation stage, the BG performance was satisfactory (RMSE = 0.62–0.83, r = 0.58–0.79). The output of this research will help decision-makers with drought mitigation plans by using the new four machine learning algorithms. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Forecasting meteorological and hydrological drought using standardized metrics of rain-fall and runoff (SPI/SRI) is critical for the long-term planning and management of water resources at the global and regional levels. In this study, various machine learning (ML) techniques including four methods (i.e., ANN, ANFIS, SVM, and DT) were utilized to construct hydrological drought forecasting models in the Wadi Ouahrane basin in the northern part of Algeria. The performance of ML models was assessed using evaluation criteria, including RMSE, MAE, NSE, and R2. The results showed that all the ML models accurately predicted hydrological drought, while the SVM model outperformed the other ML models, with the average RMSE = 0.28, MAE = 0.19, NSE = 0.86, and R2 = 0.90. The coefficient of determination of SVM was 0.95 for predicting SRI at the 12-months time-scale; as the timescale moves from higher to lower (12 months to 3 months), R2 starts decreasing. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Standardized precipitation index prediction and monitoring are essential to mitigating the effect of drought actions on precision farming, environments, climate-smart agriculture, and the water cycle. In this study, four data-driven models, additive regression, random subspace, M5Pruned (M5P), and bagging tree models, were adopted to predict the standardized precipitation index (SPI) at the Upper Godavari Basin for various periods (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). The data-driven models’ input data was pre-processed with machine learning models to increase quality and the model’s performance a priori. These four models predicted the SPI-3, SPI-6, and SPI-12 months based on three metrological station data. Based on the statistical performance metrics such as correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative squared error (RRSE), our findings showed that the bagging was the best model for predicting SPI-3 and SPI-6 while the M5P the best for SPI-12 estimation in station 1, while in stations 2 and 3, M5P was superlative in predicting the SPI-3 and SPI-12 months, and the bagging was best in SPI-6. All the best models had acceptable mid-term drought forecasting based on the SPI-3, SPI-6, and SPI-12 months for three stations in the Upper Godavari Basin in India. The machine learning models created in this study produced satisfactory results in short-term and mid-term drought forecasting, and it will be a new strategy for water developers and planners to use for future management and scheduling. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Meteorological drought, driven by inadequate precipitation, has significant repercussions for water resources, agriculture, and human well-being. This study conducted an extensive assessment of meteorological drought in northern Bangladesh, employing remote sensing indices and machine learning techniques. The main aim was to evaluate meteorological drought occurrences in northern Bangladesh from 2010 to 2019, utilizing seven drought parameters and a machine learning model. Utilizing a Random Forest (RF) model, this study employed the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as the dependent variable and seven remote sensing indices as independent variables. Through this methodology, the study assessed the significance of these indices generated by the model and integrated them, culminating in the creation of a meteorological drought distribution map spanning 2010 to 2019. This approach offers novel insights by probing the interplay and collective impacts of these indices, shedding light on previously unexplored aspects of regional drought patterns of northern Bangladesh. The major findings showed that precipitation strongly influenced both short-term and long-term meteorological drought episodes. Moreover, land surface-related indices, such as Evapotranspiration (ET) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), exhibited a more pronounced impact on short-term drought occurrences, while vegetation-related indices like Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) demonstrated greater influence over long-term drought events. During this timeframe, the Rajshahi division experienced frequent extreme and severe drought events. Moderate droughts and abnormally dry conditions were widespread. The Barind tract area consistently faced moderate to extreme droughts, with exceptions in 2011, 2014, and 2019. On average, over 5% of the region had extreme droughts, while more than 12% experienced severe droughts during this decade. Long-term drought indicators (SPI 6 and SPI 9) consistently showed higher frequencies of extreme and severe droughts compared to short-term indicators (SPI 1 and SPI 3), emphasizing the influence of prolonged rainfall deficits on extreme droughts and the relevance of longer time frames for severe drought dynamics. The RF model demonstrated strong performance with accuracy ranging from 81% to 95%. Low prediction errors (RMSE 6% to 31%) and high out-of-bag (OOB) accuracy ranging from 76% to 98% highlighted its accuracy. The F1 score consistently exceeded 76%, indicating high precision and recall. Cross-validation values ranged from 78% to 94%, affirming reliable generalization to new data. Incorporating the main findings, this study contributes valuable insights for the formulation of targeted drought mitigation strategies in northern Bangladesh. It is imperative to note that the scope of this study is confined to the northern region of Bangladesh, and generalizing these findings to other regions should be exercised with caution. Nevertheless, the research methodology and approach can serve as a model for future studies in related fields, advancing knowledge of how to assess droughts using remote sensing and machine learning methods. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - In the context of global warming, as drought episodes become increasingly frequent, it is crucial to accurately measure the impacts of droughts on the overall performance of agrosystems. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of meteorological drought indices against satellite-based agronomical drought indices as crop yield explanatory factors in statistical models calibrated at a local scale. The analysis is conducted in Spain using a spatially detailed, 12-year (2003–2015) dataset on crop yields, including different types of cereals. Yields and drought indices were spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level. The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), computed at different temporal aggregation levels, and two satellite-based drought indices, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), were used to characterise the dynamics of drought severity conditions in the study area. Models resting on satellite-based indices showed higher performance in explaining yield levels as well as yield anomalies for all the crops evaluated. In particular, VCI/TCI models of winter wheat and barley were able to explain 70% and 40% of annual crop yield level and crop yield anomaly variability, respectively. We also observed gains in explanatory power when models for climate zones (instead of models at the national scale) were considered. All the results were cross-validated on subsamples of the whole dataset and on models fitted to individual agricultural districts and their predictive accuracy was assessed with a real-time forecasting exercise. Results from this study highlight the potential for including satellite-based drought indices in agricultural decision support systems (e.g. agricultural drought early warning systems, crop yield forecasting models or water resource management tools) complementing meteorological drought indices derived from precipitation grids. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drought is a common and costly natural disaster with broad social, economic, and environmental impacts. Machine learning (ML) has been widely applied in scientific research because of its outstanding performance on predictive tasks. However, for practical applications like disaster monitoring and assessment, the cost of the models failure, especially false negative predictions, might significantly affect society. Stakeholders are not satisfied with or do not “trust” the predictions from a so-called black box. The explainability of ML models becomes progressively crucial in studying drought and its impacts. In this work, we propose an explainable ML pipeline using the XGBoost model and SHAP model based on a comprehensive database of drought impacts in the U.S. The XGBoost models significantly outperformed the baseline models in predicting the occurrence of multi-dimensional drought impacts derived from the text-based Drought Impact Reporter, attaining an average F2 score of 0.883 at the national level and 0.942 at the state level. The interpretation of the models at the state scale indicates that the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) contribute significantly to predicting multi-dimensional drought impacts. The time scalar, importance, and relationships of the SPI and STI vary depending on the types of drought impacts and locations. The patterns between the SPI variables and drought impacts indicated by the SHAP values reveal an expected relationship in which negative SPI values positively contribute to complex drought impacts. The explainability based on the SPI variables improves the trustworthiness of the XGBoost models. Overall, this study reveals promising results in accurately predicting complex drought impacts and rendering the relationships between the impacts and indicators more interpretable. This study also reveals the potential of utilizing explainable ML for the general social good to help stakeholders better understand the multi-dimensional drought impacts at the regional level and motivate appropriate responses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Millennium drought which occurred around 1997–2009 throughout southeastern Australia has led to recorded low groundwater levels causing considerable economical losses. Improving the drought resilience of at-risk groundwater systems has been recognized as a priority for sustainable water resources management in the region. This study introduces the standardized groundwater discharge index (SGDI) based on groundwater discharge to river to assess groundwater drought performance at multi-timescales for catchments in the southeastern Murray-Darling Basin. The response time of groundwater drought to precipitation drought is found to be above 12 months according to the relationships between SGDI and the standardized precipitation index. The performance of groundwater drought, indicated by resilience and resistance, overall shows that catchments with higher drought resilience are often accompanied by lower drought resistance and vulnerability. Groundwater drought is found to be less resilient but more resistant than precipitation drought due to the buffer capacity of the groundwater system. The determinants of groundwater drought performance at different timescales are identified by a machine learning approach. The relationships between groundwater drought performance metrics and their determinants are found to be highly nonlinear and distinctly different among the timescales. Climate factors and catchment physical properties can explain up to 60% of the spatial variance in drought resilience and resistance across the region at the 12-month scale. Our findings provide crucial insight into groundwater drought management and open potential pathways for improving groundwater drought resilience and resistance to mitigate the drought impacts potentially driven by a changing climate. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study investigates drought trends, SPI-SPEI comparisons, and predictions in Rangpur, Bangladesh, from 1979 to 2020. We employed Modified Mann-Kendall for trend analysis, SPI and SPEI for drought assessment, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Simple Linear Regression for evaluating SPI and SPEI relationships. Additionally, we utilized ANN, SVM, and RF for prediction. The study revealed notable negative trends in seasonal and annual drought, with the highest z statistics observed for SPI 06 (-2.75), SPI 09 (-4.50), SPI 12 (5.60), SPI 24 (-8.40), SPEI 06 (-5.13), SPEI 09 (-6.82), SPEI 12 (-8.04), and SPEI 24 (-11.20). Strong correlations were identified across all SPI and SPEI indices, with coefficients peaking at 97%, 98%, 98%, and 97% for 06, 09, 12, and 24-month periods, respectively. The comparative assessment favored SPEI over SPI, highlighting its superiority and accuracy. The ANN prediction model showed significant results for short-term and seasonal drought forecasts, projecting SPEI 03 and SPEI 06 increases of 0.02 and 0.24, respectively. However, long-term drought estimation exhibited insignificant performance across all predictive models. This emphasizes the need for developing essential predictive tools for future drought variability. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Flood and drought are frequently happening natural disasters in most of the countries. These disasters can cause considerable damage to agriculture, ecology and economy of the country. Mitigating the impacts of flood and drought is a valuable help to the human being. The main cause of these disasters is precipitation. If the past precipitation data are analyzed properly, the future flood and drought events can be easily found. Prediction using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) is a way to find the wet or dry condition of a region or country. In this paper the SPI values with different lead times are calculated for a long period of time. These SPI indices are analysed by a predictive model using the machine learning algorithm called Support Vector Regression (SVR) with RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel. In this model the Grid Search approach is used for optimization. The forecast result of this predictive model shows the predictive skill of the SVR-RBF kernel. © BEIESP.

AB  - In recent decades, catastrophic wildfire episodes within the Sumatran peatland have contributed to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the occurrence of fires in Indonesia through prolonged hydrological drought. Thus, assessing peatland vulnerability to fires and understanding the underlying drivers are essential to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for peatland. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of Sumatran peat to fires under various ENSO conditions (i.e., El-Nino, La-Nina, and Normal phases) using correlative modelling approaches. This study used climatic (i.e., annual precipitation, SPI, and KBDI), biophysical (i.e., below-ground biomass, elevation, slope, and NBR), and proxies to anthropogenic disturbance variables (i.e., access to road, access to forests, access to cities, human modification, and human population) to assess fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. We created an ensemble model based on various machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, maximum entropy, and boosted regression tree). We found that the ensemble model performed better compared to a single algorithm for depicting fire vulnerability within Su-matran peatlands. The NBR highly contributed to the vulnerability of peatland to fire in Sumatra in all ENSO phases, followed by the anthropogenic variables. We found that the high to very-high peat vulnerability to fire increases during El-Nino conditions with variations in its spatial patterns occurring under different ENSO phases. This study provides spatially explicit information to support the management of peat fires, which will be particularly useful for identifying peatland restoration priorities based on peatland vulnerability to fire maps. Our findings highlight Riau’s peat-land as being the area most prone to fires area on Sumatra Island. Therefore, the groundwater level within this area should be intensively monitored to prevent peatland fires. In addition, conserving intact forests within peatland through the moratorium strategy and restoring the degraded peatland ecosystem through canal blocking is also crucial to coping with global climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In this study the capability of two advanced hybrid artificial intelligence-based methods is investigated in modelling meteorological droughts based on the standardized precipitation index (SPI) for various time windows. The outcomes are compared with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). The best-fitted distribution functions are found to vary with respect to stations and time windows. For Canakkale, Istanbul and Tekirdag stations, the correlation coefficients (CC) of hybridized method of ANFIS with gray wolf optimization (ANFIS-GWO) and ARIMA are in the range of 0.88–0.94, 0.88–0.96 and 0.86–0.94, respectively. The performance index also showed that the ANFIS-GWO provides superior accuracy in modelling droughts, with the minimum value (PI = 0.78) for SPI12 of Canakkale station. Forward-chaining cross-validation and the P value of the Chi-squared test also confirm that ANFIS-GWO is the superior model, in which there is not a significant difference between the trend of the predicted categories and that of the real categories for all stations and SPIs. © 2022 IAHS.

AB  - Agriculture is the primary profession in India which relies on several climatic factors such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, etc., for the successful growth of crops. Weather and drought forecasting may help to take preventive measures in an unusual situation due to crop failure. Most of the existing work attempts to forecast the weather or analyse the reason for the occurrence of drought and its effects in the past. This paper adopts the machine learning model called the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast the long-term rainfall and standardised precipitation index for drought estimation. The predicted annual rainfall from LSTM is taken as an input to forecast the drought conditions of India for the upcoming years, which is a unique approach and objective, and based on this work appropriate decisions can be made for future actions. The past 117 years of rainfall and drought conditions are compared with the recent 50 years by analysing the data in several ways in order to predict the future scenario. The forecasted results are compared with actual observations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LSTM model to produce adequate results. The error and network loss of the model is 0.059 and 0.0036, which is minimal, and the forecasted rainfall level is almost equal to actual level specifically accuracy is 99.46% for the previous year, 2021. It was found that there is a rainfall decline of 0.04% every year. Apart from the prediction for the country, a clear picture of the region regarding drought forecasts is presented in this work. The real-time drought level is mild and moderate for most of the regions in the country which matches with the drought level determined using forecasted rainfall. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The predictability of droughts in China was investigated using a series of statistical, dynamic and hybrid models. The results indicate that, statistical models exhibit better skill in forecasting the Standardized Precipitation Index in six months (SPI6) than dynamic models. Overall, the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) method and wavelet machine learning models outperform other statistical models in forecasting SPI6. The hybrid model can improve the performance of SPI6 forecast by combining statistical and dynamic models using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. As for drought onset detection, the ‘low probability of detection (POD) low probability of false alarm (POF)’ and ‘high POD high POF’ phenomena exist in statistical and dynamic models, respectively. On average, less than 20% drought onsets can be detected in statistical models while less than 40% in dynamic models, with more than 40% false alarms appearing in statistical models and more than 75% in dynamic models. The hybrid model can slightly balance them, resulting in a POD of 20% and a POF of 50%. In spite of the low predictability, some stations with high equitable threat score (ETS) can be used in early drought warning under certain requirement. These conclusions may help improving drought prediction at a local or national scale. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Severe drought events in recent decades and their catastrophic effects have called for drought prediction and monitoring needed for developing drought readiness plans and mitigation measures. This study used a fusion-based framework for meteorological drought modeling for the historical (1983–2016) and future (2020–2050) periods using remotely sensed datasets versus ground-based observations and climate change scenarios. To this aim, high-resolution remotely sensed precipitation datasets, including PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS (multi-source products), ERA5 (reanalysis datasets), and GPCC (gauge-interpolated datasets), were employed to estimate non-parametric SPI (nSPI) as a meteorological drought index against local observations. For more accurate drought evaluation, all stations were classified into different clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm based on ground-based nSPI. Then, four Individual Artificial Intelligence (IAI) models, including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), were developed for drought modeling within each cluster. Finally, two advanced fusion-based methods, including Multi-Model Super Ensemble (MMSE) as a linear weighted model and a nonlinear model called machine learning Random Forest (RF), combined results by IAI models using different remotely sensed datasets. The proposed framework was implemented to simulate each remotely sensed precipitation data for the future based on CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for drought projection. The efficiency of IAI and fusion models was evaluated using statistical error metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed methodology was employed in the Gavkhooni basin of Iran, and results showed that the RF model with the lowest estimation error (RMSE of 0.391 and R2 of 0.810) had performed well compared to all other models. Finally, the resilience, vulnerability, and frequency of probability metrics indicated that the 12-month time scale of drought affected the basin more severely than other time scales. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The prediction of hydrological drought is significant for the management of water resources, planning of hydroelectricity production, agricultural production, habitat, and life of living things. The primary aim of this study is to increase the prediction success hydrological drought in the Wadi Ouahrane basin (270 km2). For this purpose, support vector regression technique is hybridized with Election Algorithm. Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) values were used to determine hydrological droughts. In calculating droughts, rainfall and stream flow data covering the years 1972–2018 were employed. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and previous SRI values were used in the establishment of the hydrological drought prediction model. The coefficient of determination, Standard deviation, the Akaike information criterion and root-mean-square error values were used to test the model accuracy. It was identified to be the most accurate according to the research outputs were obtained with SRI-12 and the Election Algorithm-based support vector regression algorithm showed successful results in hydrological drought prediction. In addition, it was revealed that realistic results are obtained when SPI value and delayed SRI values were used as inputs in multi-time scale analysis of hydrological drought. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Forecasting of drought impacts is still lacking in drought early-warning systems (DEWSs), which presently do not go beyond hazard forecasting. Therefore, we developed drought impact functions using machine learning approaches (logistic regression and random forest) to predict drought impacts with lead times up to 7 months ahead. The observed and forecasted hydrometeorological drought hazards-such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI), and standardized runoff index (SRI)-were obtained from the The EU-funded Enhancing Emergency Management and Response to Extreme Weather and Climate Events (ANYWHERE) DEWS. Reported drought impact data, taken from the European Drought Impact Report Inventory (EDII), were used to develop and validate drought impact functions. The skill of the drought impact functions in forecasting drought impacts was evaluated using the Brier skill score and relative operating characteristic metrics for five cases representing different spatial aggregation and lumping of impacted sectors. Results show that hydrological drought hazard represented by SRI has higher skill than meteorological drought represented by SPI and SPEI. For German regions, impact functions developed using random forests indicate a higher discriminative ability to forecast drought impacts than logistic regression. Moreover, skill is higher for cases with higher spatial resolution and less lumped impacted sectors (cases 4 and 5), with considerable skill up to 3-4 months ahead. The forecasting skill of drought impacts using machine learning greatly depends on the availability of impact data. This study demonstrates that the drought impact functions could not be developed for certain regions and impacted sectors, owing to the lack of reported impacts. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - There is a strong scientific and social interest in understanding the factors leading to extreme events in order to improve the management of risks associated with hazards like droughts. In this study, artificial neural networks are applied to predict the occurrence of a drought in two contrasting European domains, Munich and Lisbon, with a lead time of 1 month. The approach takes into account a list of 28 atmospheric and soil variables as input parameters from a single-model initial-condition large ensemble (CRCM5-LE). The data were produced in the context of the ClimEx project by Ouranos, with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) driven by 50 members of the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2). Drought occurrence is defined using the standardized precipitation index. The best-performing machine learning algorithms manage to obtain a correct classification of drought or no drought for a lead time of 1 month for around 55%-57% of the events of each class for both domains. Explainable AI methods like SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are applied to understand the trained algorithms better. Variables like the North Atlantic Oscillation index and air pressure 1 month before the event prove essential for the prediction. The study shows that seasonality strongly influences the performance of drought prediction, especially for the Lisbon domain.  © 2021 Elizaveta Felsche.

AB  - This paper compares the classification and prediction capabilities of decision tree (DT), genetic programming (GP), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBT) techniques for one-month ahead prediction of standardized precipitation index in Ankara province and standardized precipitation evaporation index in central Antalya region. The evolved models were developed based on multi-station prediction scenarios in which observed (reanalyzed) data from nearby stations (grid points) were used to predict drought conditions in a target location. To tackle the rare occurrence of extreme dry/wet conditions, the drought series at the target location was categorized into three classes of wet, normal, and dry events. The new models were trained and validated using the first 70% and last 30% of the datasets, respectively. The results demonstrated the promising performance of GBT for meteorological drought classification. It provides better performance than DT and GP in Ankara; however, GP predictions for Antalya were more accurate in the testing period. The results also exhibited that the proposed GP model with a scaled sigmoid function at root can effortlessly classify and predict the number of dry, normal, and wet events in both case studies. © 2021, Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The aim of this study is to select the best model (combination of different lag times) for predicting the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in next time. Monthly precipitation and temperature data from 1960 to 2019 were used. In temperate climates, such as the north of Iran, the correlation coefficients of SPI and SPEI were 0.94, 0.95, and 0.81 at the time scales of 3, 12, and 48 months, respectively. Besides, this correlation coefficient was 0.47, 0.35, and 0.44 in arid and hot climates, such as the southwest of Iran because potential evapotranspiration (PET) depends on temperature more than rainfall. Drought was predicted using the random forest (RF) model and applying 1–12 months lag times for next time. By increasing the time scale, the prediction accuracy of SPI and SPEI will improve. The ability of SPEI is more than SPI for drought prediction, because the overall accuracy (OA) of prediction will increase, and the errors (i.e., overestimate (OE) and underestimate (UE)) will reduce. It is recommended for future studies (1) using wavelet analysis for improving accuracy of predictions and (2) using the Penman–Monteith method if ground-based data are available. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Hydrological droughts may be referred to as sustained and regionally extensive water shortages as reflected in streamflows that are noticeable and gauged worldwide. Hydrological droughts are largely analyzed using the truncation level approach to represent the desired flow condition such as the median, mean, or any other flow quantile of an annual, monthly, or weekly flow sequence. The quantification of hydrologic droughts is accomplished through indices, such as the standardized streamflow index (SSI) in tandem with the standardized precipitation index (SPI) commonly used in meteorological droughts. The runs of deficits in the SSI sequence below the truncation level are treated as drought episodes, and thus, the theory of runs forms an essential tool for analysis. The parameters of significance from the modeling perspective of hydrological droughts (or tantamount to streamflow droughts in this paper) are the longest duration and the largest magnitude over a desired return period of T-year (or month or week) of the streamflow sequences. It is to be stressed that the magnitude component of the hydrological drought is of paramount importance for the design and operation of water resource storage systems such as reservoirs. The time scales chosen for the hydrologic drought analysis range from daily to annual, but for most applications, a monthly scale is deemed appropriate. For modeling the aforesaid parameters, several methodologies are in vogue, i.e., the empirical fitting of the historical drought sequences through a known probability density function (pdf), extreme number theorem, Markov chain analysis, log-linear, copulas, entropy-based analyses, and machine learning (ML)-based methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN), wavelet transform (WT), support vector machines (SVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), and hybrid methods involving entropy, copulas, and machine learning-based methods. The forecasting of the hydrologic drought is rigorously conducted through machine learning-based methodologies. However, the traditional stochastic methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), copulas, and entropy-based methods are still popular. New techniques for flow simulation are based on copula and entropy-based concepts and machine learning methodologies such as ANN, WT, SVM, etc. The simulated flows could be used for deriving drought parameters in consonance with traditional Monte Carlo methods of data generation. Efforts are underway to use hydrologic drought models for reservoir sizing across rivers. The ML methods whilst combined in the hybrid form hold promise in drought forecasting for better management of existing water resources during the drought periods. Data mining and pre-processing techniques are expected to play a significant role in hydrologic drought modeling and forecasting in future. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Drought as a natural disaster is one of the human’s ecological, hydrological, agricultural, and economic concerns. In this study, multiscale intelligence methods were proposed for drought severity detection and mapping in the northwest part of Iran for the years of 2007 to 2020. In the modeling process two scenarios were considered and in-situ and remote sensing datasets were adopted with two machine learning models namely M5 Pruning tree (M5P) and Random Forest (RF). In the first scenario, the in-situ datasets including the precipitation, relative humidity, evaporation, and temperature were used as inputs of the intelligence models to assess drought severity in terms of the Standardized Precipitation Index. In the second scenario, the SM2RAIN-ASCAT precipitation product and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) products of the MODIS were considered as inputs. During the drought severity modeling process, the input time series were first broken down into several subseries via the Variational Mode Decomposition; then, the most effective subseries were selected and imposed into the M5P and RF as inputs. Also, the potential of the relatively new TemperatureVegetation Water Stress Index (T-VWSI), which has developed based on the NDVI and LST, was assessed in drought severity monitoring. The results proved the appropriate efficiency of the proposed multiscale methods in effectively detecting drought severity. Also, it was observed that the T-VWSI could be successfully used for detecting drought occurrences in areas without meteorological datasets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Drought forecasting is one of the crucial tools for the water management system, and understanding the different climatic variables affecting the occurrences of drought is a major scientific challenge. In this study, drought forecasting is done for the Peninsular region of India using different machine learning algorithms. A meteorological drought index known as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) which is dependent on the precipitation is taken into account for analysis. The SPI with a different timescale for 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-month were calculated from 1958–2017 for 60 years. SPI is a function of precipitation and the trend of rainfall followed may be found to be similar in some regions. Two different models, GA-ANFIS and GRNN were compared in this study. The results obtained from the statistical performance assessment of the models were compared with each other. For different timescale, there is a variation in its evaluation metrics. Comparing the performance assessment of the two different models, it is noticeable that the performance assessment of the statistics of the GA-ANFIS model outperformed GRNN model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Understanding and predicting warm season (May-October) droughts is critically important in South Korea for agricultural productivity and water resource management. Using a 6-month standardized precipitation index ending in October (SPI6_Oct), we investigate the interannual variability of warm season droughts and the related large-scale atmospheric circulations for the most recent 20-yr period (1995-2014). Cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulations to the east of Japan (in the North Pacific) tend to induce warm season droughts (wetness) by suppressing (enhancing) moist water transport from the south of the Korean Peninsula. These circulation patterns to the east of Japan are linked to a barotropic Rossby wave-like teleconnection pattern from the North Atlantic to East Asia, which is found to be responsible for the interannual variability of SPI6_Oct. This teleconnection pattern is highly correlated with the difference in sea surface temperature (SST) between theNorwegian Sea and the Barents Sea (referred to asNA_dipole) in January-March (r50.68), which modulates the snow depth over the Ural Mountains in spring and the sea ice concentration over the Barents Sea during the entire warm season. Two drought prediction models, an empirical model and a hybrid machine learning model, are developed and tested for their predictive skills for South Korea. An empirical prediction model using NA_dipole as one of the predictors is found to accurately capture the interannual variability of SPI6_Oct (r2 5 53%). NA_dipole is found to improve the predictive skills of the hybrid machine learning drought predictionmodel, especially for longer lead times.Our results emphasize the significant role of North Atlantic SST anomalies in warm season medium-range droughts in South Korea. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Nowadays, drought is one of the trending topics in the world that has turned into a challenge for the world. By developing countries and cities worldwide, especially in the economic aspect, governments started to damage the environment such as through the use of fossil fuels, pollution of the seas, unregulated use of fresh water also deforestation for personal purposes. The presented research aims to change the format of drought mitigation strategies from traditional ways into the up to date treats. Leveraging AI technologies, including machine learning algorithms and data analytics, a comprehensive AI-driven drought management system is designed and implemented. In this system, inconsistent data have been obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry organization and transformed into insightful data and analyzed in real-Time style to provide the status of agricultural products in Turkey. This research contributes to the fields of environmental science and agriculture by innovatively augmenting traditional approaches with AI-driven solutions. Ultimately, our research offers a means to monitor weather conditions in different regions of Turkey, moving beyond manual drought prediction and guesswork that were prevalent in previous systems. Additionally, it facilitates the evaluation of vegetation health by considering precipitation and temperature averages in each area.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Water scarcity due to limited water resources and substantial increase in water consumption leads to drought situation many parts of world. Agricultural drought affects all walks of life in varyingly severe magnitudes. No solutions exist to completely avoid drought conditions. Analyzing past patterns through drought monitoring for early warning and predicting future drought conditionshelp to mitigate or control causes of drought in many sectors such as water management, agriculture, dam utilization and other various ecosystems. Traditionally, agriculture drought monitoring is typically supported by drought indices such as standardized precipitation index (SPI), Multivariate SPI, Palmer drought severity index, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), crop moisture index, Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, Z-index and crop specific index, and effective drought index etc to evaluate drought effects in agriculture sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) models complex and uncertain situation scholarly. Research on drought prediction uses various AI models based on rainfall/temperature data or satellite data. Convolution neural network (CNN) based drought prediction does not exist. The main objective of this paper is to predict drought or no drought condition using CNN model on the basis of NDVI computed from satellite images for a given location in Kolar district of Karnataka, India. Satellite images are obtained from National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) and converted to NDVI images. The evaluation of CNN model includes Nash index, correlation coefficient and root mean square error. The improved accuracy is observed up to 96%. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Understanding drought and its multifaceted challenges is crucial for safeguarding food security, promoting environmental sustainability, and fostering socio-economic well-being across the globe. As a consequence of climate change and anthropogenic factors, the occurrence and severity of drought has risen globally. In India, droughts are regular phenomenon affecting about 16% area of country each year which leads to a loss of about 0.5–1% of country’s annual GDP. Hence, the study aims to analyse and predict the meteorological drought in northeast India during 1901 to 2015 using standardised precipitation index (SPI) and analytical techniques such as Mann–Kendall test (MK), innovative trend analysis (ITA), and wavelet approach. In addition, the periodicity of the drought was estimated using Morlet wavelet technique, while discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was applied for decomposing the time series SPI-6 & SPI-12. Study shows that the northeast India experienced moderate drought conditions (SPI-6) in short term and two significant severe droughts (SPI-12) in long term between 1901 and 2015. The trend analysis shows a significant increase in SPI-6 & SPI-12 (p-value 0.01). Further, the combination of parameters i.e. approximation and levels result in the best drought prediction model with higher correlation coefficient and lower error. By using PSO-REPTtree, this study pioneers the use of decomposed parameters to detect trends and develop a drought prediction model. The study is the first step towards establishing drought early warning system that will help decision-makers and farmers to mitigate the impact of drought at the regional level. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Hydrological drought forecasting plays a substantial role in water resources management. Hydrological drought highly affects the water allocation and hydropower generation. In this research, short term hydrological drought forecasted based on the hybridized of novel nature-inspired optimization algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). For this purpose, the Standardized Hydrological Drought Index (SHDI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) were calculated in one, three, and six aggregated months. Then, three states where proposed for SHDI forecasting, and 36 input-output combinations were extracted based on the cross-correlation analysis. In the next step, newly proposed optimization algorithms, including Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Salp Swarm algorithm (SSA), Biogeography-based optimization (BBO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) hybridized with the ANN were utilized for SHDI forecasting and the results compared to the conventional ANN. Results indicated that the hybridized model outperformed compared to the conventional ANN. PSO performed better than the other optimization algorithms. The best models forecasted SHDI1 with R2 = 0.68 and RMSE = 0.58, SHDI3 with R2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 0.45 and SHDI6 with R2 = 0.82 and RMSE = 0.40. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Drought is a catastrophe that impacts agriculture and causes economic and social damage. An effective monitoring and forecasting system is needed to assess the extent of droughts and to mitigate their effects at both spatial and temporal levels. To this end, we used a Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in various timescales to classify and track drought events based on CHIRPS rainfall data for the period between 1981 and 2019. Three models (M1, M2, M3) were then tested for annual drought prediction (SPI_12) using precipitation data and the lagged SPI as input variables. Extreme Learning Machine algorithms displayed rapid drought prediction, with high accuracy on different timescales (0.7–0.8 R2). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigates the prediction accuracy of standalone Reduced Error Pruning Tree model and its integration with Bagging (BA), Dagging (DA), Additive Regression (AR) and Random Committee (RC) for drought forecasting on time scales of 3, 6, 12, 48 months ahead using Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), which is among the most common criteria for testing drought prediction, at Kermanshah synoptic station in western Iran. To this end, monthly data obtained from a 31-year period record including rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, and maximum and minimum relative humidity rates were considered as the required input to predict SPI. In addition, different inputs were combined and constructed to determine the most effective parameter. Finally, the obtained results were validated using visual and quantitative criteria. According to the results, the best input combination comprised both meteorological variable and SPI along with lag time. Although hybrid models enhanced the results of standalone models, the accuracy of the best performing models could vary on different SPI time scales. Overall, BA, DA and RC models were much more effective than AR models. Moreover, RMSE value increased from SPI (3) to SPI (48), indicating that performance modeling would become much more challenging and complex on higher time scales. Finally, the performance of the newly developed models was compared with that of conventional and most commonly used Support Vector Machine and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models, regarded as the benchmark. The results revealed that all the newly developed models were characterized by higher prediction power than ANFIS and ANN. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Drought is one of the major natural disasters. Improving the accuracy of drought prediction can provide reliable data to support drought response and risk prevention. The construction of suitable drought prediction models is a current research hotspot. Machine learning models are widely used for drought forecasting such as artificial neural network (ANN), wavelet neural network (WNN), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF). This paper explored and compared the forecasting abilities and stabilities of the wavelet neural network (WNN), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) in the northern part of the Haihe River Basin, China. The northern part of the Haihe River Basin is located in the upper reaches of Beijing and Tianjin, which is an important industrial and agricultural production area in China. The total area is 8.34×105 km2. It has a temperate monsoon climate with average annual precipitation of 490 mm. The models used in this paper are based on the standard precipitation index (SPI) at different time scales (3, 6, 9 and 12 months). The SPI was calculated using daily precipitation data obtained at eight meteorological points in the northern part of the Haihe River Basin from 1960 to 2010. Then, the SPI series were predicted use the WNN, SVR and RF models separately. The effectiveness of the three machine learning models is compared by Kendall rank correlation (Kendall), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test and mean absolute error (MAE). The following results were observed: (1) The prediction abilities of the WNN and SVR models vary at different time scales, with WNN performing best suited for SPI-12 and SVR best suited for SPI-6. (2) For the SPI-3 and SPI-12, the RF prediction performance was optimal (Kendall > 0.898, MAE < 0.05). For the SPI-6 and SPI-9, the SVR prediction performance was optimal (Kendall > 0.95, MAE < 0.04). (3) The stability of the model prediction performances differed, with RF being most stable, followed by SVR. (4) The variation in model predictions performance is due to the following: the convex optimization of SVR resolves the WNN weakness of falling into a local optimal solution, thereby improving the prediction performance of the model. The RF boosting diversified regression trees, which reduce the negative influence of weak learners, improve the prediction accuracy and stability of the model. Furthermore, the capacity of the RF model is strongest in its ability to cope with precipitation data that contains noise. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the drought prediction performance of multiple models at multiple time scales for SPI series and preliminarily explores the internal mechanisms of model differentiation. The result of this study provides alternative models and research ideas for the northern part of the Haihe River Basin and beyond. © 2020 Science Press (China).

AB  - Drought is a complex threat where its propagation is not yet controllable, causing more environmental, social, and economic damage. This research assesses the effects of incessant warming and decrescent precipitation by calculating SPI and SPEI from 1985 to 2021 in the Amman –Zarqa Basin based on five grid points on time and space scales. The study applied the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between each one-to-one index at different time scales and the Mann–Kendall test (MKT) to determine trends with different data sources to measure the inferential capturing of historical drought features. Machine learning algorithms are used to predict near-future droughts from 2022 to 2025. TBATS and ARIMA models run diverse input datasets, including observations, CSIC, and CMIP6-ssp126 datasets. The longest drought duration was 14 months. Drought severity and average intensity were found to be −24.64 and −1.76, −23.80 and −1.83, −23.57 and −1.96, and −23.44 and −2.0 where the corresponding drought categories were SPI-12 Sweileh, SPI-9 Sweileh, SPI-12 Wadi Dhullal, SPI-12 Amman Airport, respectively. The dominant drought event occurred between Oct 2020 and Dec 2021. CMIP6-ssp126 can capture the drought occurrence and severity by measuring SPI but did not capture the severity magnitude as the observations (SPI was −2.87 by observation and −1.77 by CMIP6). There are significant differences in drought dimensions between SPI and SPEI, where SPI was more sensitive to drought assessment than SPEI. Using CMIP6-ssp126, ARIMA was more accurate than TBATS, as well as using the observed historical SPEI and CSIC across all stations. The performance metrics ME, RMSE, MAE, and MASE implied significantly promising forecasting models with values of −0.0046, 0.278, 0.179, and 0.193, respectively, for ARIMA and −0.0181, 0.538, 0.416, and 0.466, respectively, for TBATS. The outcomes suggest an increased risk of drought incidents and, consequently, water deficits in the future. Hybrid modelling is suggested for more consistency and robustness of forecasting approaches. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Drought, and its associated impacts, represents one of the costliest natural hazards worldwide, highlighting the need for prediction and preparedness. While advancements have been made in monitoring current droughts, prediction of onset and termination have proven to be much more challenging. This is because drought is unlike any other natural hazard and cannot be characterised by a single weather event. There is also a high degree of spatial variability in this phenomenon across the vast expanse of the Australian continent. Therefore, by characterising regionally specific expressions of drought, we may improve drought predictability. In this study, we analyse the timing of onset and termination of meteorological droughts across Australia from 1900 to 2015, as well as their local and regional climate controls. We show that meteorological drought onset has a strong seasonal signature across Australia that varies spatially, whereas termination is less seasonally restricted. Using a Random Forest modelling approach with predictor variables representative of large-scale ocean-atmosphere phenomena and local climate, up to 75% of the variance in the Standardised Precipitation Index during both onset and termination could be explained. This study offers support to continued development in long-lead forecasting of local and large-scale ocean/atmosphere conditions to improve drought prediction in Australia and elsewhere.  © 2022 Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

AB  - Conventional hydrological modeling is highly tedious for a data-sparse tropical river basin heavily loaded by hydraulic structures. The application of promising machine learning algorithms in this context is not explored much. This study investigates the suitability of two machine learning approaches—random forest regression model (RF) and gradient boosting regression model (GBM) in predicting the hydrological drought indices—standardized streamflow index (SSI) and streamflow drought index (SDI) based on the predicted meteorological drought indices—standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index under the future climate Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The study predicts long-term hydrological drought indices SSI and SDI from 2006 to 2099 based on global climate models projections. The future drought years were extracted using the run theory. The study reveals that the river basin was prone to hydrological drought occurrences 50–65% of the time during the historic period (1988–2005) and 32–70% during the future period (2006–2099). It is evident from the results that both RF and GBM models follow a similar pattern of dry events in the future, which implies the prediction to be accurate. The study recommends the RF model for the study area, considering the model performances. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.

AB  - Droughts have a huge socioeconomic impact, thus globally affecting the people, the environment, and the economy on a massive scale. Proper monitoring and accurate predictions can help mitigate the ill effects of such natural calamities to a considerable level. Providing warning signals and proper preplanning can provide further solutions. Drought occurrences highly depend on the environmental characteristics of the region. To identify drought and analyze its severity level, metrological drought indices like Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) are popularly used. The present work focuses on drought prediction using three drought indices SPI, SPEI, RDI. The case of Latur region of Maharashtra, India, has been taken for the research work. The prediction model is developed using support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for varying timescales 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and the performance of the model is evaluated across measures like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This paper focus on the drought monitoring and forecasting for semi-arid region based on the various machine learning models and SPI index. Drought phenomena are crucial role in the agriculture and drinking purposes in the area. In this study, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used to predicted the future drought in the upper Godavari River basin, India. We have selected the ten input combinations of ML model were used to prediction of drought for three SPI timescales (i.e., SPI -3, SPI-6, and SPI-12). The historical data of SPI from 2000 to 2019 was used for creation of ML models SPI prediction, these datasets was divided into training (75% of the data) and testing (25% of the data) models. The best subset regression method and sensitivity analysis were applied to estimate the most effective input variables for estimation of SPI 3, 6, and 12. The improved support vector machine model using sequential minimal optimization (SVM-SMO) with various kernel functions i.e., SMO-SVM poly kernel, SMO-SVM Normalized poly kernel, SMO-SVM PUK (Pearson Universal Kernel) and SMO-SVM RBF (radial basis function) kernel was developed to forecasting of the SPI-3,6 and 12 months. The ML models accuracy were compared with various statistical indicators i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE), root relative squared error (RRSE), and correlation coefficient (r). The results of study area have been showed that the SMO-SVM poly kernel model precisely predicted the SPI-3 (R2 = 0.819) and SPI-12 (R2 = 0.968) values at Paithan station; the SPI-3 (R2 = 0.736) and SPI-6 (R2 = 0.841) values at Silload station, respectively. The SMO-SVM PUK kernel is found that the best ML model for the prediction of SPI-6 (R2 = 0.846) at Paithan station and SPI-12 (R2 = 0.975) at the Silload station. The compared with SVM-SMO poly kernel and SVM-SMO PUK kernel was observed, these models are best forecasting of drought (i.e. SPI-6 and SPI-12), while SVM-SMO poly kernel is good for SPI-3 prediction at both stations. The results have been showed the ability of the SVM-SMO algorithm with various kernel functions successfully applied for the forecasting of multiscale SPI under the climate changes. It can be helpful for decision making in water resource management and tackle droughts in the semi-arid region of central India. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Drought as a severe natural disaster has devastating effects on the environment; therefore, reliable drought prediction is an important issue. In the current study, based on lower upper bound estimation, hybrid models including data preprocessing, permutation entropy, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods were used for point and interval predictions of short- to long-term series of Standardized Precipitation Index in the Northwest of Iran. Ground-based and remote sensing precipitation data were used covering the period of 1983-2017. In the modeling process, first, the data processing capability via variational mode decomposition (VMD), ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and permutation entropy (PE) was investigated in drought point prediction. Then, interval prediction was applied for tolerating increased uncertainty and providing more details for practical operation decisions. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed integrated models could achieve significantly better performance compared to single models. Hybrid PE models increased the modeling accuracy up to 40 and 55%. Finally, the efficiency of developed models was verified for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index prediction. Results demonstrated that the proposed methodology based on remote sensing data and VMD-PE-AI approaches could be successfully used for drought modeling, especially in limited or non-gauged areas. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Since drought can mainly affect agriculture, especially rain-fed agriculture with high dependence on rainwater, and consequently jeopardize food security and social protection, it is absolutely essential to determine an appropriate drought index to assess the agricultural drought more accurately. In this paper, the random forest algorithm (RF) was employed to compare the capabilities of six more commonly used drought indices in agricultural drought assessment, namely standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), modified SPEI (M-SPEI), reconnaissance drought index (RDI), modified RDI (M-RDI), standardized precipitation index (SPI) and modified SPI (M-SPI) based on the correlation between the drought indices (i.e., independent variables) and yield of rain-fed barley (i.e., response variable). In this study, the data series of 10 stations with appropriate climate variety from 1968 to 2017 were used on 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month time scales (27 time periods in total). The results indicated that the linear regression between the simulated and predicted yield of rain-fed barley using the AquaCrop model and the RF algorithm (respectively) had no difference with a perfect reliable line (Y = X) in 0.05 or 0.01 significant levels. The R2 between simulated and predicted barley yield (YB) was also significant at 0.01 levels in all stations, indicating the appropriate capability of the RF algorithm in YB prediction. The results also showed that some indices had better outcomes than others in stations; for example, the SPEI index in Arak, Mashhad, Shahre Kord, and Shiraz stations, the M-SPEI index in Babolsar, Gazvin, and Ramsar, the SPEI and M-SPEI indices in Esfahan and Gorgan stations, and the RDI and SPI indices in Rasht stations had the best outcome. Finally, it was recommended to use the SPEI and M-SPEI indices for agricultural drought assessment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Drought is a complex and devastating natural disaster that needs to be constantly investigated. In this study, standardized precipitation indexes (SPI-3 and SPI-6) were computed using daily precipitation data collected from six meteorological stations in a Mediterranean coastal basin (Northwestern Morocco) during the period from 1984 to 2021. Subsequently, we examined the spatio-temporal distribution of three agricultural indices namely Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). Additionally, to predict SPI at two scales (SPI-3 and SPI-6), we investigated the ability of four machine learning (ML) models such as random subspace, random forest, M5P, and REPTree. ML model's performance was evaluated using statistical metrics such as R2, MAE, RMSE, RAE, and RRSE. As per SPI results, 1995, 1999, 2005, 2015, and 2017 were observed as severe driest years. Agricultural drought’ magnitude differs over time and space from 1984 to 2021. Besides, findings showed that the REPTree model achieved the best performance during the testing and validation phases, with R2 (0.64–0.85), MAE (0.37–0.58), RMSE (0.51–0.74), RAE (48.10–75.34%) and RRSE (53.24–76.68%). In contrast, RF was found to offer the lowest performance accuracy, despite outperforming during the training phase. Moreover, SPI-6 has higher prediction accuracy than SPI-3. Furthermore, our findings offer a reliable model for drought prediction, which may further assist policymakers and authorities in developing better adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce drought-related losses. In future research, we suggest exploring alternative ensemble or hybrid ML algorithms to further improve prediction accuracy and capability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an indicator of the moisture status of the land surface, which is useful for monitoring extreme weather events. Representative global SM datasets include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5 (ERA5), but due to their low spatial resolutions, none of these datasets well describe SM changes in local areas, and they tend to have a low accuracy. Machine learning (ML)-based SM predictions have demonstrated high accuracy, but obtaining semi-real-time SM information remains challenging, and the dependence of the validation accuracy on the data sampling method used, such as random or yearly sampling, has led to uncertainties. In this study, we aimed to develop an ML-based model for real-time SM estimation that can capture local-scale variabilities in SM and have reliable accuracy, regardless of the sampling method. This study was conducted in South Korea, and satellite image data, numerical weather prediction (NWP) data, and topographic data provided within one day were used as the input data. For SM modeling, 13 input variables affecting the surface SM status were selected: 10- and 20-day cumulative standardized precipitation indexes (SPI10 and SPI20), a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), downward shortwave radiation (DSR), air temperature (Tair), land surface temperature (LST), soil temperature (Tsoil), relative humidity (RH), latent heat flux (LE), slope, elevation, topographic ruggedness index (TRI), and aspect. Then, SM models based on random forest (RF) and automated machine learning (AutoML) were constructed, trained, and validated using random sampling and leave-one-year-out (LOYO) cross-validation. The RF- and AutoML-based SM models had significantly high accuracy rates based on comparisons with in situ SM (mean absolute error (MAE) = 2.212–4.132%; mean bias error (MBE) = −0.110–0.136%; root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.186–5.384%; correlation coefficient (CC) = 0.732–0.913), while the AutoML-based SM model tended to have a higher accuracy than the RF-based SM model, regardless of the data sampling method used. In addition, when compared to in situ SM data, the SM models demonstrated the highest accuracy, outperforming both GLDAS and ERA5 SM data and well representing changes in the dryness/wetness of the land surface according to meteorological events (heatwave, drought, and rainfall). The SM models proposed in this study can, thus, offer semi-real-time SM data, aiding in the monitoring of moisture changes in the land surface, as well as short-term meteorological disasters, like flash droughts or floods. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Snow is one of the essential factors in hydrology, freshwater resources, irrigation, travel, pastimes, floods, avalanches, and vegetation. In this study, the snow cover of the northern and southern slopes of Alborz Mountains in Iran was investigated by considering two issues: (1) Estimating the snow cover area and the (2) effects of droughts on snow cover. The snow cover data were monitored by images obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The meteorological data (including the precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, global solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind velocity) were prepared by a combination of National Centers for Environmental Prediction‐Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP‐CFSR) points and meteorological stations. The data scale was monthly and belonged to the 2000–2014 period. In the first part of the study, snow cover estimation was conducted by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and MLP with Grey Wolf Optimization (MLP‐ GWO) models. The most accurate estimations were produced by the MLP‐GWO and GMDH models. The models produced better snow cover estimations for the northern slope compared to the southern slope. The GWO improved the MLP’s accuracy by 10.7%. In the second part, seven drought indices, including the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Bahlme–Mooley Drought Index (BMDI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Multivariate Standardized Precipitation Index (MSPI), Modified Standardized Precipitation Index (SPImod), Joint Deficit Index (JDI), and Standardized Precipitation‐Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were calculated for both slopes. The results showed that the effects of a drought event on the snow cover area would remain up to 5 (or 6) months in the region. The highest impact of drought appears after two months in the snow cover area, and the drought index most related to snow cover variations is the 2–month time window of SPI (SPI2). The results of both subjects were promising and the methods can be examined in other snowy areas of the world. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Determining the quantitative occurrence of droughts, discovering the spatial correlation of droughts, and predicting the occurrence of undesirable classes of drinking water quality and aquifer farming is of high importance. In this research, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was calculated and analyzed with a monthly survey of 26,027 wells in 609 study areas over a period of 20 years. After analyzing the missing data, the annual rainfall was forecasted in 362 synoptic stations of the country based on an artificial intelligence model. In addition, statistical relationships were extracted in order to achieve a comprehensive and historical map of the state of shortages and surpluses of water resources, as well as verification of artificial intelligence relationships in predicting base data cultivars. The results indicated that the “mild drought” indicator was steeper than the “near-normal drought” indicator. Eventually, the southern and eastern regions and certain parts of the northeast of the country in the period from 2005 to 2015 were placed in the 7th and 8th classes, which indicates severe drought. The analysis of the period 1994–2014 showed that the plains of the Sistan and Baluchestan Province in the south-east region of the country have been significantly more affected by the droughts. With the exception of the central parts of Khorasan, the general eastern, southeast, and southern regions of the country can be considered as an absolute drought class for the long term. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - A noticeable increase in drought frequency and severity has been observed across the globe due to climate change, which attracted scientists in development of drought prediction models for mitigation of impacts. Droughts are usually monitored using drought indices (DIs), most of which are probabilistic and therefore, highly stochastic and non-linear. The current research investigated the capability of different versions of relatively well-explored machine learning (ML) models including random forest (RF), minimum probability machine regression (MPMR), M5 Tree (M5tree), extreme learning machine (ELM) and online sequential-ELM (OSELM) in predicting the most widely used DI known as standardized precipitation index (SPI) at multiple month horizons (i.e., 1, 3, 6 and 12). Models were developed using monthly rainfall data for the period of 1949–2013 at four meteorological stations namely, Barisal, Bogra, Faridpur and Mymensingh, each representing a geographical region of Bangladesh which frequently experiences droughts. The model inputs were decided based on correlation statistics and the prediction capability was evaluated using several statistical metrics including mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), Willmott’s Index of agreement (WI), Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and Legates and McCabe Index (LM). The results revealed that the proposed models are reliable and robust in predicting droughts in the region. Comparison of the models revealed ELM as the best model in forecasting droughts with minimal RMSE in the range of 0.07–0.85, 0.08–0.76, 0.062–0.80 and 0.042–0.605 for Barisal, Bogra, Faridpur and Mymensingh, respectively for all the SPI scales except one-month SPI for which the RF showed the best performance with minimal RMSE of 0.57, 0.45, 0.59 and 0.42, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Changes in precipitation as a result of climate change are becoming a widespread issue all around the world. A lack of rainfall causes a meteorological drought. The short-term Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-6) index was used to estimate meteorological drought conditions in Saudi Arabia's Asir region from 1970 to 2017. Innovative trend analysis (ITA), the Modified Mann–Kendall test (MMK), the Sequential Mann–Kendall test, and Morlet wavelet transformation were used to detect trend and periodicity in meteorological drought conditions in the Asir region. In addition, the meteorological drought conditions were forecasted by integrating Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) ensemble machine learning algorithm and an artificial neural network (ANN). Droughts of varying severity have become more frequent in Asir, according to the findings. In most stations, ITA and MMK tests have revealed a significant increase in drought. In all stations, the SQMK test revealed a big sudden year-over-year drought trend. With the exception of one station, all stations experienced extreme drought frequency discovered using Morlet Wavelet Transformation over a long period of time (10 years or more) (station 34). The PSO-ANN hybrid learning algorithm predicted SPI-6 values that had a strong correlation with actual SPI-6 values and also had lower error values, indicating that this model performed well. The PSO-ANN model predicts that the Asir region of Saudi Arabia will experience major moderate to extreme drought events in the coming years (2018–2025). The findings of this analysis will assist planners and policymakers in planning for the acquisition of sustainable agriculture in the study area. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Accurate predictions of drought events to plan and manage the adverse effects of drought on agriculture and the environment requires tools that precisely predict standardized drought metrics. Improving on the World Meteorological Organization approved Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the multi-scalar Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), a variant of the SPI, is a relatively recent drought index, which takes into account the impacts of temperature change on overall dryness, along with precipitation and evapotranspiration effects. In this paper, an extreme learning machine (ELM) model was applied to predict SPEI in a drought-prone region in eastern Australia, and the quality of the model's performance was compared to that of a multiple linear regression (MLR), an artificial neural network (ANN), and a least support vector regression (LSSVR) model. The SPEI data were derived from climatic variables recorded at six weather stations between January 1915 and December 2012. Model performance was evaluated by means of the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), normalized mean absolute error (NMAE), coefficients of determination (r2), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NASH) in the testing period. Results showed that the ELM and ANN models outperformed the MLR and LSSVR models, and all four models revealed a greater predictive accuracy for the 12-month compared to the 3-month SPEI predictions. For the 12-month SPEI predictions, optimal models had r2 that ranged from 0.668 for the LSSVR model (Station 6) to 0.894 for the ANN model (Station 4). The good agreement between observed and predicted SPEI at different locations within the study region indicated the potential of the developed models to contribute to a more thorough understanding of potential future drought-risks in eastern Australia, and their applicability to drought assessments over multiple timescales. The models and findings have useful implications for water resources assessment in drought-prone regions. © 2018

AB  - Accurate estimation and prediction of drought events are highly essential for implementing effective planning and management strategies to handle this complex natural phenomenon. Application of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for integrating satellite precipitation products (SPPs), unlike gauge observations, can furnish precise drought estimations. In this study, we have proposed and tested two approaches (pre and post-integration of SPPs) that deal with the prediction of drought employing 13 MLAs. Three SPPs are integrated under four combinations (involves two and three datasets integration) employing pre and post integration approaches to predict Standardized Precipitation Index and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index at various temporal scales (1, 3, 6 and 12-month). From the overall results, Approach-2 that involves estimation of drought before integration using MLAs proved effective than Approach-1 (prediction of drought post-integration). Neural Networks based Bayesian Regularization (NBR) under three dataset integration outperformed at all temporal scales and climatic zones of India when compared to the other 12 MLAs and two dataset integration combinations. The blended product (NBR) manifested enhancements in statistical results at all temporal scales and climatic zones. European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ReAnalysis (ERA-5) dataset performed better in predicting drought events in more climatic zones compared to Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) when compared against Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) dataset. In contrast, PERSIANN-CDR proved effective in predicting drought at the country scale. ERA-5 could be suitable for real-time drought monitoring and prediction, whereas PERSIANN-CDR can be used for retrospective drought analysis. The proposed approach and the best-performed algorithm (NBR) can be extended and applied in any climatic region for enhancing the drought predictions where remotely sensed information are accessible even in regions with finite ground data availability. © 2021 Royal Meteorological Society

AB  - CONTEXT: Accurate estimation of yield losses from natural disasters on a regional scale can guide agronomic management and agricultural insurance, transfer disaster risk, and ensure food security. Conventional yield losses, however, mainly depend on historical events, for which detailed records of locations and losses are unavailable. OBJECTIVE: The development of a disaster vulnerability model has consequently been hindered by the lack of sufficient samples. To improve regional yield estimates, a novel method for estimating yield losses and the pure insurance rate is thus strongly needed. METHODS: Using 129 major wheat-producing counties on the North China Plain as an example, we developed a drought assessment system based on crop growth modeling, machine learning, and satellite data. The initial model used was the model to simulate the crop–weather relationship over a large area (MCWLA) applied to wheat (MCWLA-Wheat), which was then calibrated by multi-step-assimilation with multi-source data. We first established various drought scenarios to simulate the impacts of drought at different growth stages on wheat yield by driving the calibrated MCWLA-Wheat. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, drought-sensitive stages of wheat varied by drought severity, with insufficient water supply during the Greenup–Heading stage having the most significant impact on grain yields. Based on the outputs of the simulation and three drought indicators—standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil moisture index (SSMI), and relative leaf area index (RLAI), we then established vulnerability models coupling the MCWLA-Wheat with statistical models (random forest [RF] and multiple linear regression [MLR]). The vulnerability model MCWLA+RF showed higher accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6% (i.e., 365 kg ha−1), relative to that of the MCWLA+MLR (RMSE = 1175 kg ha−1). Ranked in descending order, the relative importance of drought indicators at Greenup–Heading was SPI, SMMI-20 cm, and RLAI. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study has highlighted a potential method for quantifying crop disaster risk—integration of a scenario-driven crop growth model, machine learning, and satellite data—that can be applied to other crops and regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Drought modeling is vital for managing water scarcity in arid regions. It allows proactive planning, resource allocation, and policy development. A combination of statistical models and machine learning techniques is necessary to capture the complexity of drought dynamics effectively. In this study, we compare the performance of the ARIMAX hybrid statistical method and the ANN and Fuzzy-based machine learning method ANFIS for drought modeling. Among the various models examined, the most promising results are obtained using a combination of ANFIS and ARIMAX, which are subsequently employed for drought event forecasting. Notably, ANFIS exhibits lower accuracy for long-term forecasting compared to ARIMAX. The study's novelty lies in the unequivocal demonstration of the ARIMAX (3,0,2) (3,0,2,12) model's superior performance in predicting meteorological drought events. This underscores the potential of ARIMAX models in leveraging historical data for adeptly forecasting drought. Furthermore, this model is applied to multiple locations to generate a drought forecasting and risk map for future years. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Among all the natural disasters, drought has the most catastrophic encroachment on the surrounding and environment. Gulbarga, one of the semi-arid districts of Karnataka state, India receives about 700 mm of average annual rainfall and is drought inclined. In this study, the forecasting of drought for the district has been carried out for a lead time of 1 month and 6 months. The multi-temporal Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) has been used as the drought quantifying parameter due to the fact that it is calculated on the basis of one simplest parameter, i.e., rainfall and additionally due to its ease of use. The fine resolution daily gridded precipitation data (0.25º × 0.25º) procured from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) of 21 grid locations within the study area have been used for the analysis. Forecasting of drought plays a significant role in drought preparedness and mitigation plans. With the advent of machine learning (ML) techniques over the past few decades, forecasting of any hydrologic event has become easier and more accurate. However, the use of these techniques for drought forecasting is still obscure. In this study, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) techniques have been employed to examine their accuracy in drought forecasting over shorter and longer lead times. Furthermore, two hybrid approaches have been formulated by coupling a data transformation method with each of the aforementioned ML approaches. At the outset, pre-processing of input data (i.e., SPI) has been carried out using Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) and then used as inputs to ANN and SVR models to induce hybrid WP-ANN and WP-SVR models. The performance of the hybrid models has been evaluated based on the statistical indices such as R2 (co-efficient of determination), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). The results showed that the hybrid techniques have better forecast performance than the standalone machine learning approaches. Hybrid WP-ANN model performed relatively better than WP-SVR model for most of the grid locations. Also, the forecasting results deteriorated as the lead time increased from 1 to 6 months. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Water availability for agricultural practices is dynamically influenced by climatic variables, particularly droughts. Consequently, the assessment of drought events is directly related to the strategic water management in the agricultural sector. The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in different scenarios of climatic variables is a new approach that needs to be evaluated. In this context, the current research aims to forecast short-term drought i.e., SPI-3 from different climatic predictors under historical (1901–2020) and future (2021–2100) climatic scenarios employing machine learning (bagging (BG), random forest (RF), decision table (DT), and M5P) algorithms in Hungary, Central Europe. Three meteorological stations namely, Budapest (BD) (central Hungary), Szeged (SZ) (east south Hungary), and Szombathely (SzO) (west Hungary) were selected to forecast short-term agriculture drought i.e., Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-3) in the long run. For this purpose, the ensemble means of three global circulation models GCMs from CMIP6 are being used to get the projected (2021–2100) time series of climatic indicators (i.e., rainfall R, mean temperature T, maximum temperature Tmax, and minimum temperature Tmin under two scenarios of socioeconomic pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP4-6.0). The results of this study revealed more severe to extreme drought events in past decades, which are projected to increase in the near future (2021–2040). Man-Kendall test (Tau) along with Sen's slope (SS) also revealed an increasing trend of SPI-3 drought in the historical period with Tau = −0.2, SS = −0.05, and near future with Tau = −0.12, SS = −0.09 in SSP2-4.5 and Tau = −0.1, SS = −0.08 in SSP4-6.0. Implementation of ML algorithms in three scenarios: SC1 (R + T + Tmax + Tmin), SC2 (R), and SC3 (R + T)) at the BD station revealed RF-SC3 with the lowest RMSE RFSC3-TR = 0.33, and the highest NSE RFSC3-TR = 0.89 performed best for forecasting SPI-3 on historical dataset. Hence, the best selected RF-SC3 was implemented on the remaining two stations (SZ and SzO) to forecast SPI-3 from 1901 to 2100 under SSP2-4.5 and SSP4-6.0. Interestingly, RF-SC3 forecasted the SPI-3 under SSP2-4.5, with the lowest RMSE = 0.34 and NSE = 0.88 at SZ and RMSE = 0.34 and NSE = 0.87 at SzO station for SSP2-4.5. Hence, our research findings recommend using SSP2-4.5, to provide more accurate drought predictions from R + T for future projections. This could foster a gradual shift towards sustainability and improve water management resources. However, concrete strategic plans are still needed to mitigate the negative impacts of the projected extreme drought events in 2028, 2030, 2031, and 2034. Finally, the validation of RF for short-term drought prediction on a large historical dataset makes it significant for use in other drought studies and facilitates decision making for future disaster management strategies. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Drought is a natural disaster that causes significant impact on all parts of environment and cause to reduction of the agricultural products. Other natural phenomena, for instance climate change, earthquake, storm, flood, and landslide, are also commonplace. In recent years, various techniques of artificial intelligence are used for drought prediction. The presented paper describes drought forecasting, which makes use of and compares the artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), and support vector machine (SVM). The index that is used in this study is Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). All of data from Bojnourd meteorological station (from January 1984 to December 2012) have been tested for 3-month time scales. The input parameters are as follows: temperature, humidity, and season precipitation, and the output parameter is SPI. This paper shows high accuracy of these models. The results indicated that the SVM model gives more accurate values for forecasting. On the other hand, we use the nonparametric inference to compare the proposal methods, and our results show that SVM model is more accurate than ANN and ANFIS. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Drought is among the most important natural disasters influencing different aspects of human life. In recent decades, intelligent techniques have shown to be highly capable of modeling and forecasting nonlinear and dynamic time series. Hence, the present study aimed to forecast drought using and comparing the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) model, and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) multivariate time series. To this end, the precipitation data obtained from the Yazd synoptic station for a 51-year statistic period were used. Moreover, the humidity levels for short-term (3 and 6 months) and long-term (9, 12, 18, and 24 months) periods were calculated using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Next, based on the results of calculations, the 1961–2002 period was selected as the control group and the 2003–2012 period was selected as the experimental group. In order to forecast the SPI for the t + 1 period, values of SPI, precipitation, and temperature of previous eras were used. Results indicated that in a 9-months period (as the timescale), the ARIMAX model gives SPI values and forecast drought with more precision than the SVM, ANFIS, and MLP models. © 2014, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - There are indications that anthropogenic activities of man have tremendously increased extreme weather conditions resulting from global warming. This study therefore aims to determine the possibility of drought, its frequency, persistence and severity in Southwest Nigeria. The study employs the use of secondary data such as rainfall records from Ijebu-Ode station covering a period of 40 years (1974-2013) for drought computation while other parameters such as temperature, potential evapotranspiration and relative humidity were used for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based modeling and prediction of drought. The frequency of drought events was calculated using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The SPI was calculated for 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months’ time steps, and findings shows that all time steps had an increasing trend which signify excess rainfall and flooding in years to come except, the 3 month time step for the month of April that shows a significant decreasing trend, indicating an increase in drought. ANN was further used to model the drought for the 3-month time step for the month of April. Prediction of the year 2045 shows that there would be periods of severe dryness. The study concludes that the hypothesis of increasing rainfall in the tropics due to climate change does not hold for all areas and time steps, since there is indication that drought will persist in few months in years to come. Finally, more intensive study should be done to ascertain possibility of unforeseen droughts in the tropics where rainfall has been forecasted to persist. © 2017 Journal of Urban and Environmental Engineering (JUEE).

AB  - Hybrid drought prediction models were developed for areas with limited monitoring gauges using the APEC Climate Center Multi-Model Ensemble seasonal climate forecast and machine learning models of Extra-Trees and Adaboost. The models provide spatially distributed detailed drought prediction data of the 6-month Standardized Precipitation Index for the case study area, Fiji. In order to overcome the limitation of a sparse monitoring network, both in-situ data and bias-corrected dynamic downscaling of historical climate data from theWeather Research Forecasting (WRF) model were used as reference data. Performance measures of the mean absolute error as well as classification accuracy were used. The WRF outputs reflect the topography of the area. Hybrid models showed better performance than simply bias corrected forecasts in most cases. Especially, the model based on Extra-Trees trained using the WRF model outputs performed the best in most cases. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Drought over a period threatens the water resources, agriculture, and socioeconomic activities. Therefore, it is crucial for decision makers to have a realistic anticipation of drought events to mitigate its impacts. Hence, this research aims at using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to predict drought through time series analysis techniques. These adopted techniques are autoregressive integrating moving average (ARIMA) and feed-forward backpropagation neural network (FBNN) with different activation functions (sigmoid, bipolar sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent). After that, the adequacy of these two techniques in predicting the drought conditions has been examined under arid ecosystems. The monthly precipitation data used in calculating the SPI time series (SPI 3, 6, 12, and 24 timescales) have been obtained from the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM). The prediction of SPI was carried out and compared over six lead times from 1 to 6 using the model performance statistics (coefficient of correlation (R), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE)). The overall results prove an excellent performance of both predicting models for anticipating the drought conditions concerning model accuracy measures. Despite this, the FBNN models remain somewhat better than ARIMA models with R ≥ 0.7865, MAE ≤ 1.0637, and RMSE ≤ 1.2466. Additionally, the FBNN based on hyperbolic tangent activation function demonstrated the best similarity between actual and predicted for SPI 24 by 98.44%. Eventually, all the activation function of FBNN models has good results respecting the SPI prediction with a small degree of variation among timescales. Therefore, any of these activation functions can be used equally even if the sigmoid and bipolar sigmoid functions are manifesting less adjusted R2 and higher errors (MAE and RMSE). In conclusion, the FBNN can be considered a promising technique for predicting the SPI as a drought monitoring index under arid ecosystems. © 2018, Saudi Society for Geosciences.

AB  - Meteorological drought prediction depends on the ability to forecast seasonal precipitation. In this paper, a well known statistical machine learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is used to predict seasonal variations of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in four reservoir basins supplying the water demands of Tehran, the capital city of Iran. The historical time series of the meteorological variables including air temperature and geopotential height at the surface, 300, 500, 700 and 850 mbar levels in the geographical zone covering 10° to 60° north latitudes and 0° to 90° east longitudes have been selected as the model predictors. Mutual Information (MI) has been used for feature selection among the aforementioned predictors. The selected predictors in the months of April to August have been used as the SVM model inputs to predict seasonal SPIs in autumn, winter and spring seasons. The results have been compared with those of the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The comparison has shown that SVM outperforms ANN in terms of the Normal Mean Squared Error (NMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (R 2). The results have shown that the seasonal SPI values can be predicted by the proposed model with 2 to 5 months lead-time with enough accuracy to be used in long-term water resources planning and management in the study area.© IDOSI Publications, 2011.

AB  - This study explored the ability of coupled machine learning models and ensemble techniques to predict drought conditions in the Awash River Basin of Ethiopia. The potential of wavelet transforms coupled with the bootstrap and boosting ensemble techniques to develop reliable artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) models was explored in this study for drought prediction. Wavelet analysis was used as a pre-processing tool and was shown to improve drought predictions. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (in this case SPI 3, SPI 12 and SPI 24) is a meteorological drought index that was forecasted using the aforementioned models and these SPI values represent short and long-term drought conditions. The performances of all models were compared using RMSE, MAE, and R2. The prediction results indicated that the use of the boosting ensemble technique consistently improved the correlation between observed and predicted SPIs. In addition, the use of wavelet analysis improved the prediction results of all models. Overall, the wavelet boosting ANN (WBS-ANN) and wavelet boosting SVR (WBS-SVR) models provided better prediction results compared to the other model types evaluated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drought occurs throughout the world, affecting people more than any other major natural hazards – especially in the agriculture industry. An effective and timely monitoring system is required to mitigate the impacts of drought. Meanwhile, extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM), and self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine (SADE-ELM) are rarely applied as the alternative drought-forecasting tools in the meantime. The present study aims to evaluate the ability of these models to predict drought and the quantitative value of drought indices, the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). For this purpose, the sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) events at NinoW and Nino4 zones were selected for input variables to forecast drought. The SPI/SPEI values may contain a one/three/six-month dry and a one/three/six-month wet period in short-term periods, and this causes instability. For this reason, 4 models for SPI/SPEI (12 months) were trained and tested by these methods, respectively. According to two statistical indices (RMSE and CORR) and stability of these methods, the SADE-ELM models perform the best, and the performance of the OS-ELM models are better than the ELM models. © 2018, HARD Publishing Company.

AB  - An effective forecast of the drought definitely gives lots of advantages in regard to the management of water resources being used in agriculture, industry, and households consumption. To introduce such a model applying simple data inputs, in this study a regional drought forecast method on the basis of artificial intelligence capabilities (artificial neural networks) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI in 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 monthly series) has been presented in Fars Province of Iran. The precipitation data of 41 rain gauge stations were applied for computing SPI values. Besides, weather signals including Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), NINO1+2, anomaly NINO1+2, NINO3, anomaly NINO3, NINO4, anomaly NINO4, NINO3.4, and anomaly NINO3.4 were also used as the predictor variables for SPI time series forecast the next 12 months. Frequent testing and validating steps were considered to obtain the best artificial neural networks (ANNs) models. The forecasted values were mapped in verification sector then they were compared with the observed maps at the same dates. Results showed considerable spatial and temporal relationships even among the maps of different SPI time series. Also, the first 6 months forecasted maps showed an average of 73 % agreements with the observed ones. The most important finding and the strong point of this study was the fact that although drought forecast in each station and time series was completely independent, the relationships between spatial and temporal predictions remained. This strong point mainly referred to frequent testing and validating steps in order to explore the best drought forecast models from plenty of produced ANNs models. Finally, wherever the precipitation data are available, the practical application of the presented method is possible. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Drought is one of the main natural factors influencing different aspects of human life. Over the decades, intelligent techniques have proven to be very capable of modeling and predicting nonlinear and dynamic time series. Therefore, the present study aims to predict drought by using and comparing neuro-fuzzy adaptive inference systems (ANFIS), artificial neural network of multilayered perceptron (ANN-MLP) and the support vector model (SVR). For this purpose, the precipitation data obtained from the Ain Bittit station were used for a statistical period of 34 years. In addition, the short-term (3 and 6 months) and long-term (9 and 12 months) time scales were calculated using the standardized precipitation index (SPI). Then, depending on the results of the calculations, the period 1979-2000 was selected as a control group and the period 2003-2012 was selected as an experimental group. In order to predict the SPI for the (t + 1) period, SPI values, precipitation from previous months were used. The results indicated that, in the majority of time scales, the ANFIS model gives SPI values and predictive dryness more accurately than the SVR, and ANN models.

AB  - This study explores the ability of machine learning techniques coupled with the bootstrap method to forecast drought conditions. The two machine learning techniques that were used were artificial neural networks and support vector regression. The potential of the bootstrap technique to reduce the uncertainty and develop reliable artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) models was explored. The performance of the bootstrap-ANN (BANN) and bootstrap-SVR (BSVR) models were compared to traditional ANN and SVR models that do not use the bootstrap method. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) (in this case SPI 3, SPI 12 and SPI 24) was the drought index that was forecast using the aforementioned models. These SPI values represent short and long-term drought conditions and are analogous to agricultural and hydrological drought conditions, respectively. The performances of all models were compared using RMSE, MAE, R2 and a measure of persistence. It was determined that the use of the bootstrap method reduced forecast uncertainties and improved the performance of the machine learning methods.

AB  - Long-term drought forecasts can provide valuable information to help mitigate some of the consequences of drought. Data driven models are suitable forecast tools due to their minimal information requirements and rapid development times. This study compares the effectiveness of five data driven models for forecasting long-term (6 and 12months lead time) drought conditions in the Awash River Basin of Ethiopia. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI 12 and SPI 24) was forecasted using a traditional stochastic model (ARIMA) and compared to machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector regression (SVR). In addition to these three model types, wavelet transforms were used to pre-process the inputs for ANN and SVR models to form WA-ANN and WA-SVR models; this is the first time that WA-SVR models have been explored and tested for long-term SPI forecasting. The performances of all models were compared using RMSE, MAE, R2 and a measure of persistence. The forecast results indicate that the coupled wavelet neural network (WA-ANN) models were better than all the other models in this study for forecasting SPI 12 and SPI 24 values over lead times of 6 and 12months in the Awash River Basin. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the climate teleconnections with meteorological droughts are analysed and used to develop ensemble drought prediction models using a support vector machine (SVM)-copula approach over Western Rajasthan (India). The meteorological droughts are identified using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). In the analysis of large-scale climate forcing represented by climate indices such as El Niño Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole Mode and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation on regional droughts, it is found that regional droughts exhibits interannual as well as interdecadal variability. On the basis of potential teleconnections between regional droughts and climate indices, SPI-based drought forecasting models are developed with up to 3months' lead time. As traditional statistical forecast models are unable to capture nonlinearity and nonstationarity associated with drought forecasts, a machine learning technique, namely, support vector regression (SVR), is adopted to forecast the drought index, and the copula method is used to model the joint distribution of observed and predicted drought index. The copula-based conditional distribution of an observed drought index conditioned on predicted drought index is utilized to simulate ensembles of drought forecasts. Two variants of drought forecast models are developed, namely a single model for all the periods in a year and separate models for each of the four seasons in a year. The performance of developed models is validated for predicting drought time series for 10years' data. Improvement in ensemble prediction of drought indices is observed for combined seasonal model over the single model without seasonal partitions. The results show that the proposed SVM-copula approach improves the drought prediction capability and provides estimation of uncertainty associated with drought predictions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Droughts can cause significant damage to agricultural and other systems. An important aspect of mitigating the impacts of drought is an effective method of forecasting future drought events. In this study, five methods of forecasting drought for short lead times were explored in the Awash River Basin of Ethiopia. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) was the drought index chosen to represent drought in the basin. Machine learning techniques including artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR) were compared with coupled models (WA-ANN and WA-SVR) which pre-process input data using wavelet analysis (WA). This study proposed and tested the SVR and WA-SVR methods for short term drought forecasting. This study also used only the approximation series (derived via wavelet analysis) as inputs to the ANN and SVR models, and found that using just the approximation series as inputs for models gave good forecast results. The forecast results of all five data driven models were compared using several performance measures (RMSE, MAE, R2 and a measure of persistence). The forecast results of this study indicate that the coupled wavelet neural network (WA-ANN) models were the best models for forecasting SPI 3 and SPI 6 values over lead times of 1 and 3 months in the Awash River Basin. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Drought monitoring is an essential component of drought risk management. It is usually carried out using drought indices/indicators that are continuous functions of rainfall and other hydrometeorological variables. This chapter presents a few examples of how remote sensing and hydrologic modeling techniques are being used to generate a suite of drought monitoring indicators at dekadal (10-day), monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales for several selected regions around the world. Satellite-based rainfall estimates are being used to produce drought indicators such as standardized precipitation index, dryness indicators, and start of season analysis. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is being used to monitor vegetation condition. Several satellite data products are combined using agrohydrologic models to produce multiple short- and long-term indicators of droughts. All the data sets are being produced and updated in near-real time to provide information about the onset, progression, extent, and intensity of drought conditions. The data and products produced are available for download from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) data portal at http://earlywarning.usgs.gov. The availability of timely information and products support the decision-making processes in drought-related hazard assessment, monitoring, and management with the FEWS NET. The drought-hazard monitoring approach perfected by the U.S. Geological Survey for FEWS NET through the integration of satellite data and hydrologic modeling can form the basis for similar decision support systems. Such. systems can operationally produce reliable and useful regional information that is relevant for local, district-level decision making. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The level of groundwater resources is changing rapidly and this requires the discovery of newer groundwater resources. Drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting different aspects of human life and environment. During the last decades, the application of artificial intelligent techniques has been recognized as effective approaches to forecast an annual precipitation rate. Method: In this study, the association analysis of climate drought and a decline in groundwater level is addressed using Gaussian process classification (GPC) and backpropagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN). This methodology is proposed to create a framework for decision making and reduce uncertainty in water resource management calculations, and in particular to optimize the management of groundwater drinking water sources. Results: Underground water levels in 609 study plains in Iran were used to predict drought over the test period, extending from 2017 to 2021. The artificial intelligence methods were implemented in the Python programming environment to achieve an annual precipitation rate. A statistical summary of the Rasterized Cells of the zoning maps was used to validate the prediction results. Considering the relationship between water quality reductions and drought in Iranian aquifers due to the occurrence of groundwater drought periods, the results were validated by analysis of the effect of climate drought using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) on the occurrence of observed droughts with the Groundwater Resources Index (GRI). The results are well-illustrated by the observation of the predicted digits in the third dimension of the Gaussian distribution. Conclusion: According to the SPI indicator, the southern regions of the country, and especially the central parts of the plain, can be considered the most affected areas by the most severe future droughts. The prediction results indicate a decrease in drought severity as part of a two-year sequence involving a recurrence of drought exacerbation and relative decline, as well as a failed state after the critical condition of aquifers. © 2018 Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - In order to have effective agricultural production the impacts of drought must be mitigated. An important aspect of mitigating the impacts of drought is an effective method of forecasting future drought events. In this study, three methods of forecasting short-term drought for short lead times are explored in the Awash River Basin of Ethiopia. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was the drought index chosen to represent drought in the basin. The following machine learning techniques were explored in this study: artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector regression (SVR), and coupled wavelet-ANNs, which pre-process input data using wavelet analysis (WA). The forecast results of all three methods were compared using two performance measures (RMSE and R2). The forecast results of this study indicate that the coupled wavelet neural network (WA-ANN) models were the most accurate models for forecasting SPI 3 (3-month SPI) and SPI 6 (6-month SPI) values over lead times of 1 and 3 months in the Awash River Basin in Ethiopia. © Polish Academy Sciences (PAN) in Warsaw, 2013.

AB  - A high-resolution drought forecast model for ungauged areas was developed in this study. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time scales were forecasted with 1–6-month lead times at 0.05 × 0.05° resolution. The use of long-range climate forecast data was compared to the use of climatological data for periods with no observation data. Machine learning models utilizing drought-related variables based on remote sensing data were compared to the spatial interpolation of Kriging. Two performance measures were used; one is producer's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in extreme, severe, and moderate drought classes over the total number of samples in those classes, and the other is user's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in drought classes over the total number of samples classified to those classes. One of the machine learning models, extremely randomized trees, performed the best in most cases in terms of producer's accuracy reaching up to 64%, while spatial interpolation performed better in terms of user's accuracy up to 44%. The contribution of long-range climate forecast data was not significant under the conditions used in this study, but further improvement is expected if forecast skill is improved or a more sophisticated downscaling method is used. Simulated decreases of forecast error in precipitation and mean temperature were tested: the simulated decrease of forecast error in precipitation improves drought forecast while the decrease of forecast error in mean temperature does not contribute much. Although there is still some room for improvement, the developed model can be used for drought-related decision making in ungauged areas. © 2017

AB  - The reduction of drought impacts may be achieved through sustainable drought management and proactive measures against drought disaster. Accurate and timely provision of drought information is essential. In this study, drought forecasting models to provide highresolution drought information based on drought indicators for ungauged areas were developed. The developed models predict drought indices of the 6-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI6) and the 6-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI6). An interpolation method based on multiquadric spline interpolation method as well as three machine learning models were tested. Three machine learning models of Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extremely Randomized Trees were tested to enhance the provision of drought initial conditions based on remote sensing data, since initial conditions is one of the most important factors for drought forecasting. Machine learning-based methods performed better than interpolation methods for both classification and regression, and the methods using climatology data outperformed the methods using long-range forecast. The model based on climatological data and the machine learning method outperformed overall.

AB  - Drought triggered by a deficit of precipitation, is influenced by various environmental factors such as temperature and evapotranspiration, and causes water shortage and crop failure problems. In this study, sixteen remote sensing based drought factors from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite sensors were used to monitor meteorological and agricultural drought during 2000-2012 growing seasons for different climate regions in the USA. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) with time scales from 1 to 12 months and crop yield data were used as reference data of meteorological and agricultural drought, respectively. The relationship between sixteen remote sensing based drought factors and in situ reference data was modeled through three machine learning approaches: random forest, boosted regression trees, and Cubist, which have proved to be robust and flexible in many regression tasks. Results showed that random forest produced the best performance (R2=0.93, RMSE=0.3) for SPI prediction among the three approaches. Land surface-related drought factors, e.g., Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET) showed higher relative importance for short-term meteorological drought while vegetation-related drought factors, e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) showed higher relative importance for long-term meteorological drought by random forest. Six drought factors were selected based on the relative importance by their category to develop drought indicators that represent meteorological and agricultural drought by using the relative importance as weights. While TRMM showed higher relative importance for meteorological drought, LST and NDVI showed higher relative importance for agricultural drought in the arid and humid regions, respectively. Finally, drought distribution maps were produced using the drought indicators and compared with the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) maps, which showed a strong visual agreement. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drought forewarning is an important decisive task since drought is perceived a recurrent feature of climate variability and climate change leading to catastrophic consequences for agriculture, ecosystem sustainability, and food and water scarcity. This study designs and evaluates a soft-computing drought modelling framework in context of Pakistan, a drought-stricken nation, by means of a committee extreme learning machine (Comm-ELM) model in respect to a committee particle swarm optimization-adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (Comm-PSO-ANFIS) and committee multiple linear regression (Comm-MLR) model applied to forecast monthly standardized precipitation index (SPI). The proposed Comm-ELM model incorporates historical monthly rainfall, temperature, humidity, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) at monthly lag (t − 1) and the respective month (i.e., periodicity factor) as the explanatory variable for the drought's behaviour defined by SPI. The model accuracy is assessed by root mean squared error, mean absolute error, correlation coefficient, Willmott's index, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Legates McCabe's index in the independent test dataset. With the incorporation of periodicity as an input factor, the performance of the Comm-ELM model for Islamabad, Multan and Dera Ismail Khan (D. I. Khan) as the test stations, was remarkably improved in respect to the Comm-PSO-ANFIS and Comm-MLR model. Other than the superiority of Comm-ELM over the alternative models tested for monthly SPI forecasting, we also highlight the importance of the periodicity cycle as a pertinent predictor variable in a drought forecasting model. The results ascertain that the model accuracy scales with geographic factors, due to the complexity of drought phenomenon and its relationship with the different inputs and data attributes that can affect the overall evolution of a drought event. The findings of this study has important implications for agricultural decision-making where future knowledge of drought can be used to develop climate risk mitigation strategies for better crop management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The prediction of drought is of major importance in climate-related studies, hydrologic engineering, wildlife or agricultural studies. This study explores the ability of two machine learning methods to predict 1, 3, 6 and 12 months standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI) for the Wilsons Promontory station in Eastern Australia. The two methods are multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The data-driven models were based on combinations of the input variables: mean precipitations, mean, maximum and minimum temperatures and evapotranspiration, for data between 1915 and 2012. Two performance metrics were used to compare the performance of the optimum MLR and ANN models: the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). It was found that ANN provided greater accuracy than MLR in forecasting the 1, 3, 6 and 12 months SPEI. © 2015 IEEE.
